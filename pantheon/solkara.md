# Solkara Emberthrone  
### She-Who-Transforms • The Ember Queen • Heart of the Dawnforge

Solkara is the fire that **creates** and the fire that **destroys**.  
She values courage but is easily provoked into wrath.

---

---

“Burn away what is false.”  
“Give me the fire that remakes me.”

those who leap before looking—  
and sometimes save the world doing so.
