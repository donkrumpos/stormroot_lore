# Nailune, the Tide-Mother  
### Whisper of Memory • Keeper of Still Waters • Mother of the Moonlit Sea

Nailune is the gentlest of the Twelve, yet the one who carries the heaviest sorrow.  
She remembers every grief ever cast into her tide.

Her domain is **water, ice, memory, and humility**—the softening forces that temper pride.
