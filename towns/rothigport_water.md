# Rothigport  
### Town of Tideborne Humility • Driftwood Lantern-Harbor

Rothigport sits where river meets sea, a quiet harbor town of rope bridges, stilt-houses, and lanterns drifting out to sea every dusk.

The people are humble, collaborative, gentle—  
but after the Severing, reflections in the water began lying.

## Architecture & Aesthetic  
- Stilted homes rising with the tides  
- Driftwood shrines and rope-tangles  
- Fishbone windchimes  
- Soft blue and grey palette  
- Boats painted with memories (literal written memories lacquered onto hulls)

---

## Culture  
**The Washing Rites** — grief is washed off hands in the tide.  
**Lantern Night** — families release memory-lanterns at sea.  
**The Tidefall Market** — only held at low tide on sandbars.

## Notable NPCs  
- **Marra Tidepocket**, the humble mayor who refuses titles  
- **Old Netti Brackshell**, storyteller whose memory fails at high tide  
- **Fennel “Fen” Dropphone**, apprentice mapmaker who maps moods of the sea

## The Severing’s Wound  
Reflections in still water whisper insecurities or false regrets.  
Some townsfolk avoid looking at their own faces.

## Adventure Seeds  
- A fisherman’s reflection mutinies.  
- A tidepool shows a future that must not come.  
- A lantern returns to shore carrying someone else’s memory.

## Gateway to Niv'Rath Hollow  
A submerged arch beneath the docks appears only at lowest ebb.  
Lantern moss illuminates the descent.
