# Towns of Deluvia  
### The Twelve Anchors of the Elemental Wheel

The world of Deluvia is held in place not only by gods and leylines,  
but by **twelve living settlements**—each one a cultural anchor for an element,  
a virtue, and its shadow.

Every town:

- embodies one of the **Twelve Elements**  
- leans toward a **virtue** and wrestles with a matching **vice**  
- shelters one of the **indigenous peoples**  
- hosts a **shrine** to its presiding god  
- stands above or beside a **shadow-dungeon**, the corrupted echo of its nature  

Together, the Twelve form a ring of balance around the world.  
In the Age of Storms, that balance is failing.

## How to Use This Section (Design Notes)

Each individual town file (`towns/<name>_<element>.md`) contains:

- **Aesthetic & architecture** — how it looks and feels.  
- **Culture & rituals** — what people do, celebrate, and fear.  
- **Notable NPCs** — anchors for story and quest hooks.  
- **The Severing’s wound** — how the cosmic break shows up locally.  
- **Adventure seeds** — 2–3 prompts for quests or story arcs.  
- **Dungeon gateway** — where and how its shadow-realm is accessed.

This makes the Towns section usable for:

- worldbuilding reference  
- running a TTRPG campaign  
- designing regions in a video game  
- training AI tools on setting-consistent content

## The Ring of Towns

The towns can be arranged narratively or on a physical map as a **wheel**:

- Water / Fire / Soil / Life form the **foundational ring**.  
- Death / Moon / Sun / Ore create the **civilizational ring**.  
- Poison / Storm / Chaos / Wind form the **turbulent outer ring**.

Traveling clockwise around the wheel moves characters through:

1. gentler, grounded realms,  
2. brighter, more civilized centers,  
3. stranger and more volatile frontiers.

In times of balance, trade and pilgrimage follow this circuit.  
In the Age of Storms, the paths between them are fraying.

## Future Expansion

This section can be extended with:

- regional travel tables  
- town-to-town trade routes  
- political alliances and rivalries  
- seasonal variants (each town across the four seasons)

For now, it serves as the **atlas index** for Deluvia’s settlements.
