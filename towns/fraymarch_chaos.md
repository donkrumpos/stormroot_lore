# Fraymarch  
### The City of Unraveling Ideas • Plaza of Singing Shards

Fraymarch is built on floating platforms, rearranging themselves daily.

---

## Architecture & Aesthetic  
- Fragmented stone platforms  
- Rifts humming with color  
- Impossible staircases  
- Buildings with extra rooms that come and go

---

## Culture  
**The Unmaking** — artists destroy one of their works yearly.  
**Rift Lanterns** — lights that float unpredictably.  
**Chaos Feasts** — meals where courses arrive randomly.

---

## Notable NPCs  
- **Jasha Shardwright**, sculptor of broken forms  
- **Kelwin Ripplecut**, time-glitch historian  
- **Skindlewretch**, chaos sprite

---

## The Severing’s Wound  
Ideas destabilize physically—  
paintings melt, sculptures explode gently, songs rearrange mid-phrase.

---

## Adventure Seeds  
- A room appears that predicts tomorrow.  
- A rift devours colors.  
- A sketchbook draws itself.

---

## Gateway to Shatterweft Chasm  
A floating arch that refuses to remain still.
