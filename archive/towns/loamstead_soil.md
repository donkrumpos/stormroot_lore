# Loamstead  
### The Burrow-Hearth • Village of Quiet Strength

Loamstead is a village half above and half below ground—  
root-homes, moss paths, and soil-carved amphitheaters.

---

## Architecture & Aesthetic  
- Burrow houses carved into hillsides  
- Moss roofs and root buttresses  
- Clay lanterns shaped like seeds  
- Earth-tone murals  

---

## Culture  
**Burden Burying** — once a year, townsfolk bury symbolic burdens.  
**The Rootwalk** — meditative walks beneath old root systems.  
**Clay Siblinghoods** — families adopt nonrelatives through clay tokens.

## Notable NPCs  
- **Old Grunno**, potter who speaks only in proverbs  
- **Mirel Mossveil**, herbalist with roots growing from her hair  
- **Fennit Diggle**, burrow-cartographer

---

## The Severing’s Wound  
Roots sometimes refuse to grow—  
or grow too quickly, entangling homes.

---

## Adventure Seeds  
- A buried burden grows into something alive.  
- Underground tunnels rearrange themselves.  
- A giant seed pulses beneath the town square.

## Gateway to Mirefall Tangle  
A rootwell behind the amphitheater drops into twisting tunnels.
