# Age of Storms 

# Tale of bygone years

There was darkness before  
And there will be darkness after

The tales have been told since mortals have first gathered around the fire. Tales of the strange and wondrous things hidden in the vast unknown shadows of the world. Tales of creatures divine and beasts demonic; of gods and kings; of myths and monsters; from dark forests to the lands of ice; from desert wastes to the storm thrashed seas. Every corner of Deluvia has its stories to tell. Legends of h

Heroes and the villains they encounter; of the wilderness and the dangers within. Stories of battles of love of order and chaos.   
War and disease; religious and social upheaval;  the untameable ferocity of the natural world; and the monsters lurking in the deep.

\[The inhabitants of Deluvia will look to the heroic players to  heal their sorrows, and ease their regrets. The players are thrown into a broken world already operating in the aftermath of destruction, easing the regrets of the characters as they awaken to fulfill their destiny.\]

Believing the key to their future lies among the Outlands, many have ventured out to discover them. All have failed, but hope has arrived with some newcomers

## The Age of Dragons \-*12,000 januul \- 0 januul*

This is the epoch of high magic.  This is as far back as any chronicler can imagine. This age, is in fact, forgotten by men. It is told that the first dragon was born of an primordial egg floating in the aether sea. She hatched and her name was Bubuntu, and from her breath the fire combined with the water and land was formed and the steam formed the cloud sea. From her breath her children were born. The dragons ruled for eons. The dragons created magic that they tapped from and wielded upon all of Deluvia. All history of this period is lost except that current mages know how to cast magic that Deluvia is imbued with. Very few sages and mystics can speak of this history.

**Bubuntu** \- the Mother of all dragons. She bore all the dragons. Her children then ate her absorbing all the aspects of Deluvia between themselves.

**Moshrog** \- The first dragon on the Aether fog sea. The dragon of void and chaos  
**Nihlheeg** \- The dragon of death. She bites at the roots of the tree of life.  
**Gogifroz** \- the dragon of cold and of the waters of the deep and the springs that come from the deep. Her breath freezes all. Swims among the cloud sea  
**Seendhyn** \- The dragon of poison. Contaminates with her breath  
**Muspelflam** \- The dragon of fire, lava. Boils in the deep  
**Nolhaug** \- The dragon of dirt and soil burrows through all the solid layers of Deluvia  
**Serpenbath** \- The dragon of the 2 Stars of day Serbroth and Penbroth, he flies carrying the balls of fire which warms and lights Deluvia  
 (btw the Star of Night, is actually a rock moon, but referred to as a star, is called Dargunbroth)  
**Turg** \- the dragon of nature and life whose offsprings blood nurtures living things  
**Arond** \- the dragon of wind and air whose breath circles and moves around Deluvia  
**Gyrzong** \- the dragon of lightning and storms. Whose fighting amongst his brothers crashes and energizes the skies   
**Mynmeen** \-  the dragon of the moons and of night, who swallows the moons during the day and spits them out again at night. Dargunbroth (breath of less dark)  is the Night Star, the moon that presides over the moons. It is called a star, because it was mistakenly described as such during early astrologication. The servant moons as they are called, are name Gharmynith (old moon) and Felmmynith (young moon)  
**Progurt** \- the dragon of stone. Chews on the stone and creates new ores from his breath. 

Each dragon breathed their elements from the void into existence to form the world known as Deluvia. From these elements the structure and power of Deluvia herself was made. The dragons existed for eons and their breath made the elements.   
From the combination of their breath were also made the gods.

*The gods that make it through to the Age of Man have the  \<\< after them.*  
For the others have been forgotten by men and it is the worst thing for a god to be forgotten. Some fringe cults may worship the forgotten gods, but these gods have less power. For their power comes from mortals remembering them, and worshipping them

From the combination steam of the fires and ice of the breath of dragons came the gods. They are considered children of the dragons for they were born of their breath. This is The Second Age, or the Age of the Gods. the gods were many and each had their own domain. The trickster god, **Milupi** tricked the dragons into a million year hibernation. The gods created many domains of land, sky and sea and created beings called Mortals and ruled over Deluvia for a million years.  The gods had their own power bestowed in them which they waged war upon each other. The gods were jealous of magic of Mortals because it was a power they didn’t have, and a power that came from the elements deep in Deluvia, from the dragons; and the gods suppressed magic for the million years.

Here is the genealogy of the gods.  
In the Age of Gods, **Boralumugheil**, cast the land in darkness, frost and hibernation to keep his daughter, **Embreas** from being courted by **Necromensus,** (this is the metaphor of fire and ice) for they were at war with each other. Necromensus and Embreas were still secretly wed and their daughter **Freymiss** was born to grow and bring the end of the hibernation by killing her grandfather, Boralumugheil. As he lay in her arms, from her grief and guilt she shed a tear that became frozen and as it fell to the frozen ground, broke into three shards. Before Boralumugheil died, his blood fused with the tears passing on some of his power of light and dark. The shards sat on the ground and when the ground melted from the new spring, they each grew into a flower. Freymiss then went into exile.

The first generation gods generated by the dragon's breath grew to many. They themselves procreated to form many more generations of gods. These children of the dragons each had their own domain on Deluvia.

It was the trickster god, Milupi, that deceived the dragons into a 10,000,000 januul sleep.

Thus began the Age of Gods

Boralumugheil’s wife is **Sophgritus** comes from the southern jungle lands and is goddess of the winds, which is why her children are now keepers of that trait. **Finnwyl**, her granddaughter, went to Sophgritus’ homelands and now occupies the Jungle Temple, the center of the world, and where the gods met the first mortals (purportedly by those that live there and follow Finnwyl). Nemistri holds power at the Tree of the Wood, and Finnwyl of the center of Song Tide, but much of their power has been relinquished to the Age of Kings(aka Age of Mortals).

## The Age of Kings (or The Age of Mortals or The Third Age) \- *24,000 januul (present time)*

Two events that happen at the end of the Second Age are the Great War between the Gods and the Mortals, and the Great Severing, a plague born of mortal discord. The World was broken

### The Great War (the war for Deluvia)

The mortals inherited from the Dragons, their magic. The Gods had their own power of miracles which they used to keep mortals as their subjects, but this power was much different than the power of magic. The old arcane arts of magery could tap into all aspects of Deluvia herself to manipulate and wield. 

The wise Dragon race decided to keep magery from the Gods, but being their children, the Gods could still manipulate areas of their own influence (e.g. a sea god could manipulate the sea), and most Gods had the ability to bless their acolytes with health or riches, or curse them with disease. Since magery could tap into all elements of Deluvia, the Gods had become jealous of the mortals and disdain formed between the two.   
It was Zweihanar who planted seeds in the other Gods minds to limit the mortals access to magic so they could be the most powerful in Deluvia. They brought disasters and pestilence against the mortals. The Gods created the Wild Skies, a barrier between the Deluvic sphere and the aether sphere so that the mortals could not study the astros and gain more wisdom and power.  
It was also the trickster/messenger god Ratatoskel that stirred up bad blood between the Gods and the Mortals, which brought about the war. The Gods were offended that the Mortals were building towers to reach the Cloud Sea top realms, but it really hurt them when they built the first airship to fly in the realm that they considered their own, private sacred space. Zweihanar struck down the first airship of Gearheed Ninnybruck called the *Aetherwing*. The location where his wreckage went down is considered a secular holy site, which is difficult to get to considering it in one of the old realms of the gods strongholds, Frostwynn. The icy weather also makes it difficult.  
It was ironically the later technologies of the airships, among other reasons, that eventually subdued the gods.

Some of the Gods did not participate on the side of the Gods and helped the mortals. This minority was led by Pallas. Other Gods that sided with Pallas were Anona, Aethera, Tresola, Embreas and Sifaneus and many of the demigods. These god’s assistance were a huge help turning the tide of the war in the Mortals favor. And it worked out for these allying gods, since in the end, they are now the highest in the Mortals pantheon.

Some of the mortals fought on the side of the Gods in this war. They were the Frost Trolls, some factions of Goblins, Endaurs, Gargoyles and some various factions such as the Jutrollag Union Brotherhood. This did not work out well for these races in the end and they exiled themselves to the far reaches of Deluvia far away from The Central Kingdoms and Song Tide.

The Gods plan backfired on them, as the mortals, needing to survive this war, turned even more to magery to dispel the Gods back. Another large reason for the armistice was a new factor and a rising force of Druvvenrog. Druvvenrog had invested heavily in new technologies, such as airships and it were these weapons that helped drive back the Gods.

It was only a few years after the War was finished that the waters rose from all sides and the rains poured  until Deluvia was covered with water. The hour when Deluvia’s Foundations fled and the firmament was ripped

Those that sided with the gods lost. How could this be with all of their omnipotence and benevolence? Clerics say that the gods turned their backs on man and allowed the will of Deluvia to decide their own fate. 

### Before the War. Mortals ascent \- *21,000 januul*

Man also got proud and thought they were smarter than the gods. The Twelve Sages  (12 Anthoran of special birth) brought magic of the Dragons back  and man chose to use magic to be as equal as the gods. Now man uses both magic and religion as powerful forces for evil and for good.   
The Twelve Elder Sages hold the physical world together with their combined virtues. They imbue their virtues into objects in the physical world that can manifest themselves into abilities and knowledge.  
Travelers in Deluvia can obtain knowledge of the virtues of the Elder Sages by making a pilgrimage to one of the Elder Sages. Each pilgrimage is fraught with danger as each Sage secludes themselves and purposely makes themselves difficult to locate to test the will and worthiness of each pilgrim.  
The Twelve Sages were the creators gods gift to the races as the end of the Second Age dwindled to provide their virtues from themselves onto the next progeny. Only the three original creator gods participated in which is why it is a direct line to them, and other virtues exist from the whole pantheon that are not listed here.

The Twelve Sages:  
**The First:** The first to come into the Third Age. The conceiver of Knowledge. His Deluvic name is Vorishba  
**The Aggressor:** The first to strike and see opportunity. The wielder of physical power and cunning to gain territory for their fellow clan.  
**The Cleric:** Seeks balance through transformation and commune with gods. Her name is Sylwyn  
**The Leader:** Holds power to sway their fellowkind to greatness in battle and to govern.  
**The Judge:** Finds fairness through discernment \- The Law Giver  
**The Free Spirit:** Not beholden to any other law. Finds strength in serendipity.  
**The Warrior:** Has skill in battle and tactics.  
**The Prosperous One:** Has much land and coin.  
**The Scholar:** The holder of knowledge from books. (His Deluvic name is Meruk)  
**The Merchant:** The crafter and seller of goods. Makes good deals.  
**The Transformer:** Transmuter of physical substances  
**The Consumer:** Hungry for information and resources and the spark of existence.

During the Age of Man, 3 of the 12 Sages, during their wanderings, came across the 3 goddess flowers, and each picked and took one for themselves. When they found their resting place and planted the flowers, they bloomed into women goddesses. Each of the 3 women took the 3 Sages for their husband. They were Falthori, Seydna, and Calnora.  
Falthori married The Free Spirit begat Charn, Bristor, Epleyna  
Seydna married The Scholar begat Seritipi, Finnwyl, Nemistri  
Calnora married The Transformer begat  Malfisis, Dalmisis, Brumisis

From all of these were born the beings that would become the first of the Age of Kings. All the children rose to greatness at some point but it was Seritipi whose realm held over to the age of mortals. That is to say, her land of Frostwynn is the only land that is intact, just as it was during the Age of Gods and not altered or destroyed by the war between the gods and man.

They built kingdoms and one such kingdom which would become the central city called Pallamost. Their god, Zweihanar was planning on taking over the rest of the gods.Pallas put a stop to this with the help of the Twelve Sages. The Twelve Sages fled from Pallamost to prevent this but the gods put a curse on Deluvia and and the Wild Skies poured rain and covered Pallamost and all of the kingdom in water.  The war between Pallas and Zweihanar left battle scars across Deluvia. Some have become sacred to either Pallas’ or Zweihanar’s acolytes. The Twelve Sages spread across  Deluvia, to high points to stay above the flood waters, and to keep watch over the gods so that they would not come back to overpower man.   
Though Pallamost’s kingdom was mostly covered in water from the great Deluge, the temple to Pallas remained on top of the highest mountain. The Pallamostian’s thought this a great sign and still worship Pallas as the greatest in their pantheon.  New Pallamost, which it is called now, is considered the strongest city of worship and protection of the gods. Many clerics seek pilgrimage to the temple to Pallas.

One far off colony of Pallamost, also survived The Great Deluge. This small mining and fishing town was called Druvenrog, for its founder, Aldvader Grimstok the Druv. Aldvader developed a special hatred for House Azernaths, the family of kings of New Pallamost, after Jom Azernath IV sent him on  a scouting mission to develop a new colony. Grimstok never reported back and vowed to conquer the Azernath kings and all of Pallamost.

Aldavar Grimstok the Druv, a Nemedi was determined to unify the disparate Nemedi clans, and the even more estranged sibling race of the Formoris, an oppressed race for their strength, they were stolen as slaves to use in other empires.   
Two long separated siblings of races, the **Nemedi** and the **Formori** joined forces against Pallamost because of their antipathy for the gods, especially the god Pallas. The Nemedi  
 The Blackcoats, as the Nemedi are called during this Civil war,

Jillicut Sisterhood

Druvenrog is the name of the group of islands now owned by The Corporate Dominion. It wasn’t always that way. 400 years ago, it started as a burgeoning fishing village that was one of the many colonies of Pallamost. After the Great Cataclysm, the great kingdom of Pallamost was in upheaval and confusion, and they retreated to their central capitol leaving the colonies to themselves. Many of the colonies were lost to the deluge, and many others succumbed to the barbarians on the outer rim. Druvenrog was fortunate to be high in the mountains and was able to escape most of the effects of the deluge.   
Druvenrog was only the name of the first town established and this is why the whole confederation of guilds on the planet still refer to the collective whole as Druvenrog. It is actually three major islands of Dregno, Merismeet and Krylla as well as some minor islands. A few mining towns popped up on all the different shores of the three islands, and in the beginning, they were in competition with one another. There was a contest to see which guild could expand the fastest and claim the most land and resources. Druvenrog was rich with ore, lumber and other resources giving the greedy, everything they needed.

* Aldvader Grimstok the Druv, [^2]started working his claim on the eastern shore and founded the village of Druvenrog on the island of Merismeet. His grandson, Ladd Grimstock III now runs the guild. Grimstok, the Elder, (the grandfather called Grimstok Aldvader) still lives in his upper castle advising his grandson.  
* Choru Duthmor starting working his claim on the northern shore and founded the village of Dunt Tallow Bay on the island of Merismeet. His grandson Broz Duthmor  now runs the guild.  
* Matssor Arcasi starting working his claim on the western shore on the island of Dregno. His grandson Genssor Arcasi now runs the guild.  
* Maney Germoonth started working his claim on the southern shore and founded the village of Hergestine on the minor island of Helog. Due to his species living longer than most, he is still running the organization  
* Elmrif Tarkon \- started working his claim on the northern shore and founded the village of Daemmelport on the island of Merismeet. His grandson, Elmrif Tarkon III now runs the guild.  
* Dryzini Biniscot was from Shimaantanople and the michithyoqua species of Gillaquid. She named her town Grazainisco. He started working his claim on the southern shore and founded the city of Grazainisco on the island of Krylla. His granddaughter Kryllic Biniscot now runs the guild.

The leader of a House is called A Gog, or The Gog (e.g. Gog Grimstok)

Mostly cabals

The purges; unholy terror  
The reign of terror, “rain” of terror He is the rainmaker

It was these 5 that banded together to form the Council of Druvenrog. These 5 Houses would be called The Five and form the core of Druvenrog politics. They all had common values that were disdain for Pallamost, no love for the gods, and to build the greatest civilization in Deluvia.

Each of the families grew in competition of one another and tried to destroy each other at first. But then they realized the House Pallamost would come back once the kingdom was recovered from the calamity of the Cataclym and they realized that they could become more powerful if they allied together. So they created the Articles of Agreement which would commercially bind them together as one Corporation. Each guild family had their own business needs in mind and would equally send representatives to The Corporation Council to decide how best to rule the affairs of their interests. Each guild would mostly control what happens in their own borders but would band together for defense and set price controls coming in and out of Druvenrog. Each year one of the six guilds would elect a Chairman to break any ties and lend general leadership.

Over the years rivalries flared up between the Guilds and the petty bickering allowed some new ones to enter The Corporation. They are considered the Lower Guilds.

Monnothonian Guild \- airship manufacturer  
	President Teedle the Repaler  
Begeron Guild \- casino operator, shipping and transport  
	Telason Treer is the administrator  
Nimmodius Guild \- airship manufacturer  
	Falk Bylglord  
Gronosial Guild \- spice mining  
	Gynomo Poxron  
Flamigor Guild  \- weapons manufacturer  
	Beed of Samsog

Each of the Lower Guilds has a significant business on Druvenrog which is why they are allowed to be on The Corporation Council. Each has a guild hall and some territory, but not nearly as significant as the Upper Guilds. They contribute a half vote and can never send up a Chairman. They can however, send up a Vice Chairman for a half-vote.

The Doxy, is the code of Druvenrog ideals, mostly the articles of corporation.

Neogardia Settlement is the island that the Formori have been relocated to after the Nemedi settled on their other lands.   
Since the Nemedi’s colonized the land of their brothers, the Formori, the Formoris have been relegated to their islands in the south and are permitted to come to the main island to work in the factories and then are shuttled back to Neogardia. There are near constant skirmishes throughout Druvenrog between the Formori and the Nemedi’s Blackcloaks.

Druvenrog is now a  powerful trading center in which families vie with each other and shift alliances for political control. The Council of Druvenrog, which is the confederation of guilds, changed names  to The Corporation, to include all the major islands of Druvenrog Major, and all of the colonies founded around Deluvia. After The Great Deluge, contact to most of the colonies on The Outer Rim was lost. The Corporation, which prided itself as a capitalistic hegenomy.

Below the Lower Guilds are what people refer to as The Gangs of Druvenrog[^3]. These are guilds that don’t have any representation on The Corporation and usually do business illegally, outside the Articles of Agreement and price fixing. They still do, however, participate in the economy of Druvenrog in direct and indirect ways. Some want to be considered legitimate Lower Guilds someday and some are just petty thieves. The Guild Gangs compete and war among each other and form their own alliances. Many have it out for the Upper Guilds and perform espionage and sabotage of their factories. Many specialize in a certain type of trade, whether it be firefighting, goldsmithing, espionage, iron mining, or shipbuilding. These gang-guilds are what might be considered a middle class and achieve some minor wealth. Others wallow in poverty and street war.

The Noble Guild Houses:

* Arch Gog Grimstok \- the founding family of Druvenrog; a mining guild (One of The Five)  
* Gog Ritter Tarkon \- architecture and building (One of The Five)  
* Gog Commissar  Duthmorr \- Espionage and security (One of The Five)  
  Gog Baroness Biniscot \-  gold and diamond trading guild  (One of The Five)  
* StormFather Arcasi \- Air ship guild and connected to to the ancient Storm Kings (One of The Five)  
* 

The  Main Higher Guilds:

* Gog Treychon \- a shipping guild Treychon Trading Company  
* Gog Commissar  Tallow \- Ore processing guild  
* Gog Overseer Steedstoss \- Automaton guild  
* Gog Templar Shrevemakis \- a military and security guild  
* Gog Doge Dokstead \- Military, mercenaries  
* Gog Prince Monnothrot \- Prison and military lower guild  
* Lady Gog Begeron \- poisons and potions and elixers; casino operator, shipping and transport Lower guild  
* Gog Nimmodius \- airship manufacturer lower guild  
* Gog Daimyo Gronisial \- spice mining lower guild  
* Gog Viceroy Flamigor \- Forging and mining \- lower guild  
* Gog Chancellor Germooth \- Horographilogists (Germooth Agency is a science guild conducting secret experiments) government test subjects. There are also secret cults following the horographilogists.

* Ichor graft \- a type of bionic/cybernetic augmentations done by the Horogromancers

All of these Guilds form what is called The Corporation. The Corporation runs all things on Druvenrog and have formed a law enforcement force called The Security Enforcement Patrol Apparatus (The secpats or the brownclads). Over the generations this has been shortened to secpats as slang. Each family contributes some soldiers to form these troops.

Druvenrog is also home to thousands of gangs that run outside of the law. Things are far too complicated for the Five and secpats to monitor or quash the gangs. Each city and district has their own turf wars going on and The Security Enforcement Patrol Apparatus (The secpats or the brownclads) seems to be able to do little about it. There is a sense of pride that each gang has, each with their own banner, colors and officers. There is a lot of respect among the gangs for a code of honor, which is different from the main culture, because they disobey the law. Some are directly related to worker's unions or crafting guilds that offer protection to each other, smuggle goods, have religious undertones and have various other crime syndicates, but they have been known to have alliances among each other from time to time. Some ask why The Security Enforcement Patrol Apparatus let this all go on, and the answer is that they will disappear deep in the subterranean tunnels and sewers and are hard to locate. The other answer is that many of the wealthier gangs pay off The Security Enforcement Patrol Apparatus, with ties that go all the way to the top.  
Some of the prominent gangs are listed below. (note: there are too many to keep track of and this is all that is available from the chroniclers)  
The major cities of Druvenrog and their gangs

Northtop is the highest peak and one of few access points through Wildspace into Kapasia, a land of floating islands. The other mountain range is called Hergestine. Hergestine has Gozon buried within it, and the Forge of the Mountain King, one of the dwarven enclaves on Druvenrog.

Druvenrog is the home of all races and represents a good cross-section from across Deluvia. The largest population of dwarves in Deluvia resides in Underdeep. Though the gargoyles have been exiled, The Goblin King Aleighgazor (and his twin, Teshgil) ‘s band of goblin refugees have found home in Gozon. Golgime is the largest commercial district in Deluvia and is home to the most diverse races and highest population density. Skirmishes erupt often, but are quickly quelled. Golgime is also known for its strict militia presence on the island by the Corporation's own Law Machine. Dunsbay Tallow is one of the most technologically enabled towns on Druvenrog, but there is also a great disparity between rich and poor and the economic caste system is alive and apparent. The dock and factory workers have resorted to living near the factories in which they work, which is mostly in lower Golgime and Krucikruss Rookery, and the living conditions can sometimes be dismal and crime, high.

Druvenrog slang:

*  a Jakker is someone who is good at using technology for their own malevolent purposes;   
* skrapper is a tinkerer who can make their own make-shift inventions from parts they "found" and scavenge   
* Skiffrunner \- a small water craft for racing and smuggling goods small distances  
* Garks \- The gangs’ name for the House nobles  
* Krats (aka Kratters) \- The gangs’ name for the House nobles  
* Patter \- a merchant  
* Grifter \- a swindler  
* Brownclads (or TBrownclads) \- The Security Enforcement Patrol Apparatus  
* Gin tuner \- a mechanic of skiff runners  
* A Ginner \- a racher of a skiff runner

Aguygent Prowgnaw  
A Chronicler writes  
A thousand ships with a thousand cargoes are being unladen every week; and not only is every package of this vast and varied merchandise picked up and set down accurately but each is weighed and opened; sampled and recorded and again, stitched up and laid in its place, without haste or waste or hurry or confusion by a very few men in short sleeves; who working with the utmost organization in the common interest are yet able to pause in their work and say to the casual visitor, would you like to see what sort of thing we find in sacks of cinnamon? Look at this snake\!'

* 

The Lower class are all the workers in the factories, the service industry and all the poor people that don’t have jobs. Life can be dismal and unhealthy for them, from the putrid water, to the hazy polluted air. Conditions in the factories are not safe either. This group makes up fifty percent of the population of Druvenrog. Many are new immigrants looking to find new fortune in this city of opportunity.

By the end of the first generation of settlers the villages became cities and the borders started to get close to butting up against one another. Thankfully the Articles of Agreement handled who got what. Upstart guilds would wedge in between any open territory. Cities would build up into the sky and down into the dirt to gain more territory.

During the second generation it was decided to build a canal system in and through Druvenrog. Each city was responsible for its own portion, which lead to no universal system of travel. This still greatly improved travel throughout Druvenrog, but was disorganized.  It was at the end of this generation that two great discoveries were made, The Great Forge, and The Northtop Passage.

The Great Forge is deep down in the bottom of the stone and dirt, but it was a fire that seemed to never burn out and burned hotter than any fire ever seen. It was magical. The Corporation harnessed this energy for even greater forging of materials and built a structure around it to limit its use from outsiders.

The Northtop Passage is small opening in the Wild Skies that leads to more open skies above. The Wild Skies, a layer of clouds and storms that wraps the planet and doesn’t allow anyone or anything to pass through. This one unique area on top of Northtop Mountain was a break and allowed for new opportunity for exploration. Here they discovered the lost race of Kapasian Elves, that were lost to Deluvia one thousand years ago. This is where the Druvenrog expansion up would stop, as they feared the Elves and formed a treaty to leave them alone.

Over the course of the second generation, The Corporation formed The Security Enforcement Patrol Apparatus (TBrownclads). A group of elite soldiers that would police the islands and as well as the coastline. They would crack down on the gangs and try to keep prices intact. They root out gangs and keep marauders and pirates at bay. 

With all of the new found riches and success, The Corporation got greedy and turned its back on magic. The Security Enforcement Patrol Apparatus was entrusted to stop its usage and an elite group of The Security Enforcement Patrol Apparatus, known as The Inquisitors, became mage hunters and hunted down any remaining mages and slaughtered them calling magery a heretical impurity. The only power The Corporation wanted on their island was the power of commerce. Indeed Druvenrog was now rich and powerful. They had no need for magic or religion. All of the shrines and temples were shut down and converted into shops, offices or factories. 

Now at the end of the third generation, a new technology of airship travel has been invented allowing travel to far off lands especially up to Kapasia in the Wild Space. New trade routes can be established which is desperately needed for Druvenrog as they have no more space for lumber or for farming. They need to import so much wood and food to keep building their structures and feeding their people.

The third generation of Guild leaders is aging and ready for a new brand of leaders. There is much pressure coming from everywhere  threatening their existence; from the far off Demons wanting to rule the world, the pirates on The Long Sea raiding trade routes, new upstart empires from the Outer Rim, New Pallamost wanting to regain their former glory, and rot from within.

Druvenrog and The Corporation do seem to be the most powerful regime of the Central Kingdoms during current time. New Pallamost still has its highly trained army and The Kingdom of the Wood has power in magic but airship travel give Druvenrog a huge edge.

## The Founding of Druvenrog

Aldvader Grimstok the Druv was sent by Jom Azernath IV of Pallamost to found a new colony. Grimstok was part of of the Pallatian Council and had ambitions of his own. He went the opposite direction he was ordered to go until he came upon a group of islands he named Druvenrog after his kind, the Druvs, a subgroup of Nemedi,. Along with Grimstok was Uftan the Good, Surtyrbrok, Sithoan Freeg, Yome Yordok, and a group of marines for military support. They all decided together, to break ties with Pallamost and form their own empire.   
**Grimstok** despised the gods for their pettiness. He wanted to start a civilization that was free of the gods, and had their own free will.

The island he settled, he called Merismeets, because of the River Meris, Meris being his wife’s name, and where the river meets The Long Sea.

Soon after, Broz **Duthmorr** landed upon the shores of what was now called Druvenrog. Duthmorr, a fellow Anthoran, but of the Rood clan, which had rat-like form. Duthmorr had like values and also disliked the gods so him and Grimstok formed a close friendship. 

Another settler that came was Genssor **Arcasi**, about 1 year after Grimstok arrived. Arcasi was from a far off land and of a race called the Nemedi. He landed on the western shores on an island that he called Dregno, after an old Nemedi god. 

At about the same time, Elmrif **Tarkon**, an administrator from the Old Pallamost, also seeking refuge from the imperialism and self-piety of Pallamost. He named the city he claimed Daemmelport. Tarkon was half Elfinfolk and half Otaur Anthoran.

Krylic **Biniscot** landed upon the southern island of Krylla (named after herself), she was from Shimaantanople and the michithyoqua species of Gillaquid. She named her town Grazainisco.

It was these 5 that banded together to form the Council of Druvenrog. These 5 Houses would be called The Five and form the core of Druvenrog politics. They all had common values that were disdain for Pallamost, no love for the gods, and to build the greatest civilization in Deluvia.

They all knew that they were in competition with one another, but that they also had to work together to grow stronger than Pallamost. These Families vie for control over Druvenrog and the balance goes back and forth.

## Druvenrog today

Maintain order and restore prosperity 

Druvenrog is now a  powerful trading center in which families vie with each other and shift alliances for political control. The Council of Druvenrog, which is the confederation of guilds, changed names  to The Corporation, to include all the major islands of Druvenrog Major, and all of the colonies founded around Deluvia. After The Great Deluge, contact to most of the colonies on The Outer Rim was lost. The Corporation, which prided itself as a capitalistic hegenomy.

The Noble Guild Houses (Metabarons):

* Arch Gog Grimstok \- the founding family of Druvenrog; a mining guild (One of The Five)  
* Gog Ritter Tarkon \- architecture and building (One of The Five)  
* Gog Commissar  Duthmorr \- Espionage and security (One of The Five)  
  Gog Baroness Biniscot \-  gold and diamond trading guild  (One of The Five)  
* StormFather Arcasi \- Air ship guild and connected to to the ancient Storm Kings (One of The Five)  
* 

The  Main Higher Guilds:

* Gog Treychon \- a shipping guild Treychon Trading Company  
* Gog Commissar  Tallow \- Ore processing guild  
* Gog Overseer Steedstoss \- Automaton guild  
* Gog Templar Shrevemakis \- a military and security guild  
* Gog Doge Dokstead \- Military, mercenaries  
* Gog Prince Monnothrot \- Prison and military lower guild  
* Lady Gog Begeron \- poisons and potions and elixers; casino operator, shipping and transport Lower guild  
* Gog Nimmodius \- airship manufacturer lower guild  
* Gog Daimyo Gronisial \- spice mining lower guild  
* Gog Viceroy Flamigor \- Forging and mining \- lower guild  
* Gog Chancellor Germooth \- Horographilogists (Germooth Agency is a science guild conducting secret experiments) government test subjects. There are also secret cults following the horographilogists.

* Ichor graft \- a type of bionic/cybernetic augmentations done by the Horogromancers

All of these Guilds form what is called The Corporation. The Corporation runs all things on Druvenrog and have formed a law enforcement force called The Security Enforcement Patrol Apparatus. Over the generations this has been shortened to secpats as slang. Each family contributes some soldiers to form these troops.

Druvenrog is also home to thousands of gangs that run outside of the law. Things are far too complicated for the Five and Brownclads to monitor or quash the gangs.Each city and district has their own turf wars going on and The Security Enforcement Patrol Apparatus seems to be able to do little about it. There is a sense of pride that each gang has, each with their own banner, colors and officers. There is a lot of respect among the gangs for a code of honor, which is different from the main culture, because they disobey the law. Some are directly related to worker's unions or crafting guilds that offer protection to each other, smuggle goods, have religious undertones and have various other crime syndicates, but they have been known to have alliances among each other from time to time. Some ask why The Security Enforcement Patrol Apparatus let's this all go on, and the answer is that they will disappear deep in the subterranean tunnels and sewers and are hard to locate. The other answer is that many of the wealthier gangs pay off The Security Enforcement Patrol Apparatus, with ties that go all the way to the top.  
Some of the prominent gangs are listed below. (note: there are too many to keep track of and this is all that is available from the chroniclers)

The Mage Trials

Northtop is the highest peak and one of few access points through Wildspace into Kapasia, a land of floating islands. The other mountain range is called Hergestine. Hergestine has Gozon buried within it, and the Forge of the Mountain King, one of the dwarven enclaves on Druvenrog.

Druvenrog is the home of all races and represents a good cross-section from across Deluvia. The largest population of dwarves in Deluvia resides in Underdeep. Though the gargoyles have been exiled, The Goblin King Aleighgazor (and his twin, Teshgil) ‘s band of goblin refugees have found home in Gozon. Golgime is the largest commercial district in Deluvia and is home to the most diverse races and highest population density. Skirmishes erupt often, but are quickly quelled. Golgime is also known for its strict militia presence on the island by the Corporation's own Law Machine. Dunsbay Tallow is one of the most technologically enabled towns on Druvenrog, but there is also a great disparity between rich and poor and the economic caste system is alive and apparent. The dock and factory workers have resorted to living near the factories in which they work, which is mostly in lower Golgime and Krucikruss Rookery, and the living conditions can sometimes be dismal and crime, high.

Druvenrog slang:

*  a Jakker is someone who is good at using technology for their own malevolent purposes;   
* skrapper is a tinkerer who can make their own make-shift inventions from parts they "found" and scavenge   
* Skiffrunner \- a small water craft for racing and smuggling goods small distances  
* Garks \- The gangs’ name for the House nobles  
* Krats (aka Kratters) \- The gangs’ name for the House nobles  
* Patter \- a merchant  
* Grifter \- a swindler  
* Secpats (or TBrownclads) \- The Security Enforcement Patrol Apparatus Gin tuner \- a mechanic of skiff runners  
* A Ginner \- a racer of a skiff runner

A Chronicler writes  
A thousand ships with a thousand cargoes are being unladen every week; and not only is every package of this vast and varied merchandise picked up and set down accurately but each is weighed and opened; sampled and recorded and again, stitched up and laid in its place, without haste or waste or hurry or confusion by a very few men in short sleeves; who working with the utmost organization in the common interest are yet able to pause in their work and say to the casual visitor, would you like to see what sort of thing we find in sacks of cinnamon? Look at this snake\!'

In the main current story line, Druvvenrog is pursuing imperialism and colonization and even hopes of ruling all of Deluvia and exporting its values to all of Deluvia.This would include extinguishing magic and religion. They are also experimenting with ichor tech that is actually extracting the blood of hibernating dragons far below in the core of Deluvia (they don’t know they are dragons, they think the dragons are a myth and/or long extinct)

Exodus Stronghold  
(Exod Arcem)  
The settlers were making their way east to escape the wars and disasters trying to create a new life away from the Central Kingdoms  
Exodus Stronghold was the first outpost built in the east but was quickly overrun by bandits that have lived in the outlands for many years before.  
Once and while a new set of settlers will try to keep the island as a home

Padula Anchorite  
(this can be a potential starting location)  
The Padula acolytes also founded the Padula Anchorite a small recluse but recently turned to a market and stationed with a few guard to fight off bandits. It was thought that the Padula monks had been wiped out by bandits but a merchant came across the anchorite and found that they were still alive and well. Somehow a market was allowed on the lower tier of the outcrop. The Padulas withdrew to their small monastery on the higher levels of the outcrop. They allowed the merchants to come and go as they realized that they could not survive entirely by themselves, as now a few guards were always present to protect the merchants, the goods and even themselves. No one is allowed to talk to them, and they are rarely seen. Some chroniclers write that the Padulas were worshippers of the dragons and went out to the eastern outlands to wait for their return.   
One secret to them repelling the bandits, is the steep walls of their small island make it easy to defend. The guards that are maintained on the island do a great job at keeping attackers at bay. One might  wonder why they are so elite to protect such a small, nondescript rock in the middle of The Long Sea. 

Friar Wover  
Abbot Dreer  
Prior Sleegs  
Friar Dicant  
Friar Sigfint  
They are all clerics of medium power and a member of their own guild of gnomish tinkers called the Padula Anchorites. They worship the God Talluk in their small chapel.  
The build small parts (parts for clocks, locks, they don’t know what they end up being used for, but their order has always been craftsmen)  that they trade with other ports across The Long Sea.   
Talluk is the patron god of craftsmanship and is sympathetic to Mortals and offers blessings. He often is a patron god of gnomes, dwarfs and goblins, and of tinkers, blacksmiths and other crafters. His acolytes seem to always be industrious, practical and frugal.  
Even the Padulas like to keep to themselves and guard the secrets of their guild. They don’t do their business in the market at the base of their Abbey, but rather separately in ships that come at different times, and mostly with Rothigport.  
This order does not intend on growing any bigger, but since Prior Sleegs is near the end of his aging life, they do seek to replenish their numbers to stay at a group of 5 eventually.  
They observe the market below, without anyone knowing, looking for potential candidates to join their ranks. All three of, Wover, Dicant and Sigfint want to be promoted to Prior after Dreer passes.   
The candidate must be a cleric already seeking the wisdom of Talluk. Though the brotherhood will teach the new acolyte the necessary spells and tinker skills, they send potentials off on quests to test their worth.

One of their secrets is that they are hiding a Formori princess that has escaped from the mines of Didolmauz where her people are imprisoned. Her enslavers, The Pallamosts are searching for her, so it is important that this secret is kept. This is too far away from the Pallamost homeland for them to be too worried.  
The new acolyte must also keep this secret and help in this cause.

# Song Tide

Song Tide is one of the ancient lands not yet touched by the new. It is a combination of the old domains gods and of magic. It is one of the few strongholds of magic which has all but been vanquished from the rest of Deluvia by the Central Kingdoms of Pallamost and Druvenrog.  
It can be found on the western edge of the wilderness and on the outer fringe of the civilized kingdoms.   
Geography:  
Song Tide is a grouping of islands.   
**Noctisbard** is the most populated island and, in the North central area. Gargium Channel is to the east. Goylsmuth Bay is to the east where Rothigport, the largest town in Song Tide is. The Omphalos is also here. On the south area of Notisbard is the Sanctuary shrine to the fairy goddess Wispa  Mynia- of lilac fairies

**Rystrilmyl** is the second largest island and is located in Western Song Tide. It is so named because of the swamp that is on the Eastern side of the island.  On the west side of the island, in the middle of the forest is the small stone-towered town of **Magewood**, which is now called **Pippinsnest** since the Raven Clan has taken it as their home land. From their leader Pippin  
On the western driftless gorges is the Mage Guild town called Anona’s Oasis and also the Tomb of God  Anona (the third king) and his cult resides here. On the North central coast is the town of **Runesbrook**, a commune of glyph scribes, looking into the deep mysteries of the Deluvic language. Many know that Runeload Hepstupitan has a shop here where adventurers can learn the craft of rune marking and much more. The Glyphics and Runelords are able to etch runes and imbue and extract magic from them, especially travel and time magic.  
**Migreelamyre** is a bog that is the southern part of Rystrilmyl. The Mandagoras is on the Eastern side of the island.

**Roolpellikarta**  
Is the land around the mermaid and pirate town.  
The eastern side of the island is the home of the Badger clan and they call that area the Bent Buggle Burrows

**Dergheim** is the largest island of the Song Tide In the far east of the Geistgor Mountains is **Bristlechill Keep** the home of **Ukra Ospirion**, a baroness tinker. **Nax Hollum** lives in **Raxelcroft** on this island just southeast of Rothigport.  
In the center is Requilly Moors and the small town of **Lullyfort**.   
	Lullyfort nestled at the foot of the Geistgor Mountains, considers themselves Shepherd of the Requilly Moors, that it overlooks. The original builders of this town were the Mice Clan so many of its residents are still that, but many other creatures inhabit Lullyfort and dozens of pilgrims come through each day given its location near many interesting destinations.  
The Guild of Shepherds keeps monsters and marauders at a minimum, so most travelers through the Moors can feel safe.  
Goylstone River runs east out of the bay from Rothigport and leads up the Geistgor Mountains into the Bristlechill peaks. At the top and source of the river is a cave that leads down to the Glistelgeth Caverns where the entrance to the Dirt Kingdom is.  
**Mideluviput** is the fourth largest island and towns of **Hawk Finster Hollow** and **Thistle Hymn** are located here.  
**Dreglematia** is a large island in the south of Song Tide that contains the mage tower of **Reg Therox**  the wizard of the lake. Dregor Lake  
**Chantwood Isle** is fifth largest island and the small town of Minwood Snag in the tree valley land of Fernfullow Vale  
 Henz Riggleboot  
	Characters: Francis Tuckles, Brinstly Boggs, Archer Demmins, Swilly Fisher  
Francis Tuckles lives in Bentbuggle Burrows and has never ventured far off this little lush island of Chantwood. He lets the adventures come to him. In the evenings he is the lead lute player in his band The Wailing Banshees at Tallytuck Pub. During the day he wanders around the island finding valuables that he sells to adventurers that he crosses paths with.  
Being Badger Clan has its advantages as he uses his adept digging skills to find treasures beneath the island mountains. He is not too shabby with staff weapons, his favorite being his Bō, and he'll use it when he is grumpy and gets in a quarrel, or to defend the honor of an insulted bar maiden at the pub, which is far too often the burrowfolk will tell you.  
**Ildaria** is an island,and the home of **Timistrius**, the gardener wizard and her Ildarian Gardens, and the location of one of the ancient Ildarian Guardians of the Song Tide.  
**Volykragulon** is the island of the volcano in Song Tide. The sorceress **Orta Vollim** lives on the south side of the island. She is one of the Four Archmages  
**Nismrit** is a small island in Western Song Tide and home to **Voluk Nissrut** the mage and herbalist, one of the Four Archmages

**Lalfyn**  
**Gailyth**

**Scarburry \- the pirate town**

**Cantosturmo (or Cantomaran)**  Bardtown is the second largest town in Song Tide and is considered the home of the bards. (although bards are in every town and in the countryside as well) It is spread across two islands Cantos and Turmo and is a town of allure and festiveness, including the amphitheater where aspiring actors and musicians can perform. Some of the most prestigious Bards in Deluvia live here. They reside in their cottages to stay close to their fans and accolytes and get inspired writing and composing by the seaside and once in a while, performing at the famous amphitheatre

Cantosturmo was founded when a merchant vessel  captained by **Kersirus** and crew was lured to the rock by the enchantress Kixie with her enthralling music. **Kixie** grandaughter of Zeyphant the Tempest, had lured many ships into the rock called Cantosturmo throughout the ages where their timbers were smashed and sunk along the shores. It was Kersirus and his shanties that changed her mind and her song and eased his ship gently into shore. There Kersus and he crew stayed on the barren rock. The crew married Kixie’s maidens and Kersirus married Kixie and they begat Manesk the Bard. **Manesk** took the best of his mother’s wailing, luring songs, and combined the aspects of his father’s sea shanties which became the spellsongs that this future town would be known for. These legends grew of the spellsongs across Deluvia, drawing chroniclers, and performers, which helped build the town.   
It also drew the attention of Meruk, one of the 12 Sages, the sage of scholars and chroniclers, for he wanted to watch, how this town would develop in preserving the lore of the world.  
Kixie the lesser but immortal goddess, moved out into the Long Sea to mourn Kersirus after his mortal death, but many still worship her. Kixie now resides east of Song Tide on a rock of The Long Sea and plays her harp, no longer luring fisherman, but playing dirges for her lost soul mate. Those that still worship her, can visit her, though they have to get through the maelstrom. Once they do, they can learn the Dirge of Kirsirus, a most ultimate melody that can bring armadas crashing down if in the wrong hands.

Bardtown is a festive town which seems to have a party somewhere in the town every night. Often the amphitheatre is the center of activity, where people gather when there is not a performance. There is also a nice garden at the top tier where bards mingle with other socialites of the town. The Greater Songtide Symphony also performs here on a regular schedule, which  that includes members from many towns across the Song Tide and beyond.  
Krizdo and is wonderwagon are often found outside the city limits on the beach as he is no longer allowed in town for the fires and havoc he’s caused. He comes back once a moontick or and some of the citizens that want to remain in contact will go down to see him.

Bardtown is the City of Harmony. And the City of Sandstone. It seeks harmony and balance in all things. It wishes to keep all the elements of Deluvia in balance with each other and not let any virtue outweigh another.

**The Gryphon** is the Inn on top of the hill. 

**The Saddle and Loom Fine Wools** is the tailor and leather armorer. Piper (fox clan) is a weaver and tailor that is almost always in need of more wool. Thorn (bear clan) is her husband and he is the leather armorer. Both can teach the skill of tailoring, but Piper can mend clothing and has a minor skill for leather if she has to, and Thorn will repair leather armor at an expert level. Piper and Thorn Wisterthimble have been running the shop for many years and have been providing the best apparel and armor in central Song Tide.   
Piper will ask you to gather her some wool for her and in return will pay you and provide you with a new sewing kit. Piper also crafts all of the linothorax armor for Thorn’s sets which need them.  
Thorn will ask you bring bring him some leather and in return will provide you with the **Musicians Satchel**, and its recipe to craft it. The satchel is a special pouch that holds reagents and materials specific to the bard.   
Both of them have better quests and rewards later on.  
The player can also buy any basic tailoring item from either of them. And these two are also experts in imbuing songspells in their armor and can set you down that path.

**The Lute and the Lyre**, is the music shop and tuner shop. **Dryope** the Tuner is the shopkeep and she will tune your harps, lyres, lutes or most any instrument, to keep it in tip-top shape.  
She will sell or buy a variety of instruments

**Cybellis the Organist** \- has been cast down to the bottom layers of the Whisperfount for the strength of her sound from his most unusual instrument. The strange storms that this column of air will produce. Now her air travels up through the central column of the library creating unusual but melodic sounds.  Her assistant **Tymp** scurries around the chambers gathering books for Cybellis to use in her arrangements.

The central chamber of the Library of the Whisperfount also holds **Pagas’ Pendulum** suspending down from the tabula phobia organum to the library bottom, through the central chamber. Pagas, part scientist of time and part musician studies the movement of the pendulum and the writings it makes as some signs from the gods for new songprayers to Kixie or Zeyphant.

**The Sodality of Bards** is the largest known association of creative arts in Deluvia and its main guild hall is in Bardtown. They are the keepers of tradition for this part of Deluvia. They work together to progress their craft and keep the ancient stories and make new ones. If they have a Grand Bardic meeting they will meet in the amphitheatre. Though they welcome all of the different studies of Bards, they specialize in the Hall of the Glossolalia, which is another way of saying they study the old Deluvic language to decipher the power in its mysteries. In the mystical script of knowledge, the adept acts as a glossator, unraveling the cryptic verses with the fervor of glossolalia, revealing hidden truths in the sacred dance of interpretation

The Conservatory of Cantosturmo is behind the stage, with study chambers and sleeping quarters for students, wishing to become a bard. This is where there is a secret passage to Whisperfount and the eventually the belltower.

They meet deep in the Whisperfount. On Whisperfounts first layer is the tabula phobia organum.   
There exists the membrane which taps into the meta-arcana, which is the vibrations and frequencies of Deluvia’s inner song.

The Five Halls, if apprenticed under, will offer new specializations to the player beyond the core Bard spellsongs

Cantosturmo Bardic House “Luskala” or “The Steps” is the name of the amphitheatre that the bards make their center of activity. The Steps are used by some halls as an initiation right, for initiates to climb reciting lines or lyrics according to the Hall. This metaphor runs strong in Bardtown.

**The Six Bards** of Bardtown as they are often called; though there are more, especially aspiring musicians and poets, they are the most well-known in the realm and patronize their associated Hall. 

Ansturn Cagliostros \- a bard that has his house in Bardtown. He is called Cagliostros by all and is a legendary living poet best known for his work “The Peliziod”.

A bard is also a path to the Druid class among other ways (cleric and ranger are others ).

Temple of the StormCallers \- Followers of the Tempest God, Zeyphant the Storm Lord, whose songprayers calm or stir up violent storms. Stormweavers and Stormlight  
	Many join this religion to become the title of Troubadours a cleric poet that tells and since the stories of the Awesome and Terrible power of  Zeyphant. When achieve, these Troubadours of Zeyphant evangelize Deluvia, though Zeyphant himself only resides in and around the Song Tide archipelago and rose to prominence after the War, after his mother, Vulsong was humiliated during the Great War and exiled to the Great Down Below.

**The StormCaller Belltower and Lighthouse** is a landmark used by seafarers through this central passage of Song Tide. but also as a location for initiating a bard cleric of the Stormcallers Sect, as they climb the 32 steps and recite each of the 32 songprayers to Zeyphant, 16 of which to calm storms, and 16 to surge storms. When at the top they sing their own songprayer that they had spent the last 8 januul crafting and see if Zeyphant will accept it. Some troubadours at this point, will be swept away from the winds and it is unknown if Zeyphant has thrown them into the mouth of his sister, Moskvrek, or ascended them to a prophet. 

Not to be confused with the storm magic that is the element energy, but this is the water and wind control of the gods and the prayers that draw forth the blessings or malediction.  
They have a chamber they named **Whisperfount** dug in the middle of the mountain where they preserve the knowledge of Zeyphant and the ancient Deluvic tongue which can be used in songs and prayers. There is a large library which goes far down below the mountain.  
The most prominent prophet of Zeyphant is Rastream who lives in the cleric chambers of the Whisperfount. The Library of WhisperFount is their collection of ancient Deluvic Codexes. The Stormcaller sect tend to stay out of the public and stay in the chamber writing their tombs and practice reciting their prayers.  
The regular public, that are not part of this religion don’t see much of the practitioners, except to hear their prayers come out of the belltower and feel the winds that are derived from their songs.

This is the largest sect of Stormcallers outside of the of the Cathedral of the Wind, which makes this a stop along the Galestrom’s Path, a quest for acolytes of Gods of the Wind.  
This is a path to become a Storm Paladin 

Prayers:

Devotion to Doldrums  
Quellwinds Carol

Whisperwind \- this song can carry a prayer to a friend that is far away  
Psalms of Serenity \- Slows winds and stops combat and aggro  
Intercessory Breeze \- Can remove curses from a friendly party from the god being prayed to  
Breath of Vulsong \- Bring Vulsong into battle for you  
Blessing of the Fleet \- Blesses all friendly party’s ships  
Headwinds Hymnody \- this will make your ship fast and steady  
Luckwind \-   
Ghostwind \- Brings the ghost ship  
Mistral Madrigal- Inspired to Kixie, enchants a ship to crash on land  
Dirge of the Direwind Depths \- pulls an enemy’s ship down  
Fugue and Fury  
Requiem for the Tides  
Chorus of the Howling Ventwind  
Cyclone of Consecration  
Wrathwind of the Lamenter  
Ragewind Redemption  
Kirsey’s Squally

These are all songprayers of past acolytes that have now become part of the canon and written in the **Hymnal of the Stormlord** 

Stormcallers are often employed on ships to try to calm the weather as the ship is crossing The Long Sea, or to provide a wind, when there is not one, speeding their journey		

**Krizzdo the goblin tinker magician**, travels to Bardtown once a month or so on his many rounds across the Song Tide islands with his Wonder Wagon to peddle goods and show off his latest tricks. In the beginning, Krizzdo would come all the way into Bardtown and even convinced the leading bards to let him on stage, but one evening, Krizzdo was to surprise the audience with his most amazing tricks ever. It backfired on him and the stage started on fire. (it was rebuilt to be even more magnificent) He was never allowed back in again. So when he comes he stays outside the city limits and tries to get the attention of travelers and someday, once again impress the performers of Bardtown and become one of them with his act.

Krizzdo (when first seeing the player) “hrrrmm, the wind blows in another mortal from far off lands. Can you help dearest traveler. I can make it worth your while.”

Player: “What is wrong sire?”

Krizzdo “You mock Krizzdo, but I am desperate and you seem stronger and smarter than most that pass here, so I will tell you. My wheel here is broken”

“Can you find a bolt for it lying around here? If you can and repair my wheel, I, Krizzdo the Magnificent, at your service, will give you the show of your life of anything that can be seen across all The Long Sea”

(There is a bolt lying near the wheel and if the player picks it up and clicks the wheel, it is fixed. Tinkering skill goes up)  
 I can see that you might become as good at tinkering as me some day (game message: to view your specializations type /spec).   
“If only my eye sight were as good as it once was. Alas I now have these amazing goggles.”

“For your generous efforts, let me perform one of my. . . let me look here in my bag of tricks. Hrrmmm.”  
Ah yes\! The Sapper Trap, as I like to call it. Here\!”  
(hands player a black dirty metal ball)  
“I will show you how it works. Hold it out in your hand and say these words “Bippity Destrit Kapow.”  
(the ball explodes in Krizzdo’s face with some marvelous particle effects)  
“Well you will get the idea with some practice”   
(The sapper trap is actually kind of useful, especially at higher levels)  
“Come back later to my Wonder Wagon, when I get my show all sorted out”  
“Not impressed?”   
“Okay”  
“Listen to this\!.  
 I can get you into Bardtown faster and most wonderfully extraordinary than others all looking to get in”  
“Bardstown is full of pretentious smucks, so this grand entrance will make an impression on them”  
“Hop into my mortal cannonball shooter right there”  
(player gets in, if not) “Hurry get in before the fuse goes off”  
(either the player gets in or doesn’t, if they don’t)   
“Your destiny, not mine. Walk the path and you’re no friend of Krizzdo”  
(if player gets in)  
“Wazoo\! Here we go.”  
“3”  
“2”  
“1”  
“Pow\!”  
(the player gets launched in the air and lands at the top garden of Bardtown)

If player gets shot to the top of Bardtown, they are near Pewter the pot and pan seller,  
She locks the player in conversation   
Pewter “Wow that was quite an entrance\!”  
	“Welcome to Bardtown. You must have quite the abilities to drop in like that.”  
	“ I am Pewter and I can help you find your way around here”  
	“ Up here a lot of people find solace and inspiration looking out into the seas of Song Tide, but if you go straight east then left at the end, you will find the main Bard Guild Hall. or head down the hill, you can find the **banker**, Bertaire which can help you store your goods.”  
“Here it looks like you might need these”   
(Pewter gives the player some food and starting tools)

Gilderstilt Oveeris the Bard Guild Master of the Hall of Glossolalia, a descendent of Kersirus but took the path of language and devotes himself to the study of the Ancient Deluvic and in persuasive discourse. He is also one of the head glossators and town elders..  
He is from Raven clan, but as a youngling, was thrown from the nest and was severely disformed and now wears a Mask of the Glossator.   
He is charged with preserving the Codex Decretiglos \- or the ancient law.   
He can introduce the player into the Hall of Glossolalia

Upon click he looks up  
Gilderstilt “Oh, I’m sorry, I didn’t see you there. I am deep in my studies”  
	“Us Glossators need much focus to keep up these texts”  
	“But I have time for a newling like yourself.”  
	“ I find myself inquisitive to the newlings bopping about the halls and streets.”  
	“ I don’t need to be distressed, do I?  
	“Either way, we have to sustain the Codex even more now to chronicle these events”  
	“Are you with me?”  
	“Oh wait, this tinged a nerve of passion for me’  
	“You know not of these things”  
	“I apologize again. It is simply nice to have a visitor here by our hearth.”

Player:

1. But I would like know more about what you are talking about.

**Euphemid** is another member of the Hall of Glossolalia

**Yewestra** the hermit shepherd. She lives on the far side of Westerisle island. She provides parchment to Gilderstilt and the Hall of Glossolalia for their books. but has not been able to get enough leather and wool lately.  
She is also a Druid in hiding. Later the player can discover this  
   
Drekko and Antercantus

**The Seven Slayer books**   
We all know there are the 7 slayer types  
\- humanoid (opposite undead)  	Location: Wraithwood Blight  
\- reptile  (opposite to arachnid)  	Location: Gilgome Desert  
        	\- undead (opposite humanoid) 	Location: Songtide Islands- Garoot’s Cabin  
        	\- fey (opposite abyss) 		Location: Duhmkaazm Abyss  
        	\- elemental (opposite all others) 	Location: Songtide Islands \- Laelaps the storm watcher  
        	\- abyss (opposite few) 		Location: Feycundia Forests  
        	\- arachnid (opposite to reptile) 	Location: Rystrilmyl Swamp

These hunter bestiaries, are tomes, with the lore gathered by Hunters (rangers) over the centuries and carry the knowledge of beasts of this type. When obtained, and studied, the hunter gains bonuses against these types. For example, if the ranger has obtained and studied the Undead Bestiary, they gain a damage bonus using ranger specialization attacks against all undead. Over time they can learn new specialization skills specific for the monster type. When using the Tracking skill, they gain a bonus when searching for that monster type.

The tome’s keepers are spread throughout Deluvia, but some lie in Song Tide.

They can be copied by scribes, but the original needs to be found by Rangers.

The first one the players are likely to encounter is at Garroots Cabin

Another source of information is Wulvern, the huntsman. He can give the Spear of the Huntsman.  
He belongs to the Fraternity of the Fleetfoot, a guild of rangers that has a mission to purge the Outlands of the Warlords that are creeping in on The Songtide.

# The Creatures of Songtide

The overworld creatures  
Kobold (caves)  
Goblin  
Gnoll (various locations )  
	Gnoll hunter  
	Gnoll Warrior (spearman, pikeman  
	Gnoll Shaman/Cleric  
Gnoll Marauder  
It is believed by some that gnolls had traces of demonic blood, which may be evidenced by unusual features found among some of the gnoll bloodlines. These may have included talons, gleaming red eyes, or black fur with fiery orange spots.  
There are two encampments in Songtide.  The Gnolls are ferocious and sometimes raid the other towns in Song Tide, so most residents don’t get along with them. Most times the gnolls keep to themselves  
Clawfold Pack  
Mamblesnear Pack  
They are at war with each other and sometimes other towns get caught in the middle. These wars are part of their ritual so they never get too large or out of control. The other residents of Song Tide look at it as a game, as long as they don’t get caught in the middle.   
Gnolls don’t use magic, but have some religion, and their shamans can do some prayer spells.

The Feud between the two packs over hunting territory keeps some balance between them and is a tribute to their main god, **Fermangal**, a petty demi god who uses their bloody feud for his amusement.   
The player can interfere with this feud, play one side or broker a truce.  
When the player comes across a Gnoll Camp. The god they worship, Fermangal, plays tells different things to different clans to make them hate each other and garner their worship. Whichever clan worships him more, he will aid in battles against the other Clan. If the player can help them realize this, the Clans will work together, find new gods and broaden their pantheon. Fermangal will be angered and become an enemy of the player, but the player will have the Gnolls as an ally.  
	Step 1: Find all the Gnoll camps. There are 4 in each Clan spread throughout Song Tide. They are nomadic, so they travel from one to the other, in no particular order.  
In each camp, the Gnolls will not attack the player until the player attacks them. They are busy hunting and gathering and preparing war against the opposing clan. The Gnolls have no quarrel with the non-Gnolls unless they are aggressed upon.  
If they find all of one clan and attack in each camp, the opposing clan, once discovered, will talk to you in their language and give you a reward, The Talisman of Furboor. They assume you are helping them defeat the other clan. This is where the player can learn of this feud. The system keeps track of the amount of blood spilled per clan, by the player, and the more on one side will keep them in favor with the other side.

Mamblesnear \+4 || Clawfold \-4  Mamblesnear gives player Talisman of Furboor  
Mamblesnear \+3 || Clawfold \-3  
Mamblesnear \+2 || Clawfold \-2  
Mambersnear \+1 || Clawfold \-1  
Mamblesnear 0 || Clawfold 0 (neutral)  
Mamblesnear \-1 || Clawfold \+1  
Mamblesnear \-2 || Clawfold \+2  
Mamblesnear \-3 || Clawfold \+3  
Mamblesnear \-4 || Clawfold \+4   Clawfold gives player Direheen Katar

When the player is neutral or positive in one clan, that clan will no longer attack the player. But the more negative a clan is, the more all of that camp will attack you.

You can collect the pieces of a gnoll disguise from various NPCs in Song Tide. 

1. The shaman gnoll headdress (one for each clan)  
   1. The player must find a shaman from the clan and be at \+4 in that clan.  
   2. If the player is the cleric class then the shaman gives the player the headdress  
   3. If the player is a class other than a cleric, they must go through an initiation ritual  
   4. They receive a healing salve, learn the Nightmare spell for completing this.  
2. The gnoll pelt \- not much for armor, but gives frost protection and Blood Lust skill  
3. Claws of the Mongrel \- a weapon with slashing attacks and blocking abilities  
     
   Depending on which headdress is work, this will also give you one extra negative toward the other clan. With will double their aggro against you if worn in their presence.  
     
   Step 2: The shrine to Fermangal:  
   The Gnolls, when talking to the player, will mention Fermanal and the offerings, though it will be unclear with their broken common mixed with Gnollish.  
   They could also stumble upon the shrine and learn the entry point into this lore event.  
   If they come without the Gnoll disguise Fermangal will think they are of that Gnoll clan and try to manipulate the player as if they were a member of the clan. The player can then realize the deep deception that Fermangal is using to manipulate her acolytes.  
     
   	  
     
     
     
   Gnoll the exhile  
     
   Gnolls are Song Tiders afterall and defend against any marauders that come by to pillage the islands  
     
   They are nomadic and use boats to go from island to island. They appear at a different location depending on random factors  
   

Formoris \- angry warlike humanoids (location: Snarlbush )  
The Formoris here are the last of their kind as much of their race was enslaved by the Druvvenrogs mining facilities. This is one of the last enclaves that is free.

### Rothigport town Lore:

Rothigport owes much of its economic good  
fortune to its thriving port, the Dockway.  
Tradespeople from every social class do  
business throughout the Dockway district at all hours  
of the day and night, and the unfettered flow of goods  
provides Rothigport with a reputation as one of Song Tide’s  
most essential trading centers.

Rothigport is the major market town in the northern Song Tide Archipelago  Though Song Tide itself is as old as the Age of Man, Rothigport was founded about 500 januul ago. It was built on water by people who saw the water as a defense and ally. Rothigport, being one of the first seafarering people in Deluvia, built the town out in the harbor so the warring kingdoms at the time had no successful way to raid this floating town.   
It was first a dock where fisherman would come to trade hooks, nets and other equipment in the northern harbor of Goylsmuth Bay. It slowly grew over the next few hundred years as each fisherman would build a new shanty next to the last and the town cobbled together more huts and storage for their fishing industry.  This village has grown into a small city with a trading network that is now vast in Song Tide.

Recently a causeway was built connecting Rothigport to the larger island of **Noctisbard**,  to the west, called Modrik’s Causeway after the engineer who designed it. This trade route has yet to be as traveled as much as their water ways to the North and to the east but those who petitioned to build the causeway think it will become a major trade route to the rest of the islands eventually.. Sea travel is primary to the Song Tiders. Still, pilgrims, adventurers and students of the arcane walk this route on their way back and forth.

Song Tide is a fertile and diverse region so all types of beings have now settled in Rothigport, and all the warring kingdoms of the past have settled their differences and come together to grow the town. The region is also home to some magic users since it is far from the arcane-adverse Central Kingdoms. Yet, because it is a larger town, magic is kept somewhat secret, because of traveling merchants and emissaries from The Central Kingdoms might trigger a purge or war. That is to say, though there mages and wizards in Rothigport, they don’t make outward displays of magical spells and instead live out among the rural islands.

One of the reasons Rothigport survived The Great Deluge was because all of the houses are floating docks and rose with the waters.  The Goylsmuth Bay provides some protection from storms and the town founders saw to keep an open area in the center for boats to moor and dock for extra protection. The town was one of the more peaceful areas in Deluvia for a few hundred years. Only recently has crime increased because of refugees trickling in from the Central Kingdoms. The town has grown a lot in the last few decades as it is now a hub of trade for the Song Tide region. **Percimor**, the town mayor, has taken leadership and governs from his manor in the south of the harbor. Since the Deluge,, the town’s outward physical growth has mostly stopped for now, but that does not stop refugees from other areas from coming in.

Some new rumored threats have emerged to the peace-loving Rothigportians that, Druvenrog, far to the east and known for their hatred of magic, has put some of their interest toward Rothigport. Though they are too far away to pose much of a worry, there are some doomsayers in Song Tide who preach the demise of their own land.   
The rise of Necromensus and his demon clans is known but the people hope for the protection of the powerful arch mages that are known to live nearby. Many acolytes of Necromensus pray to him in shrines across Song Tide but Necromensus’ ambitions have become apparent and the strength of his magic grows.  
There are marauders and pirates who have also threatened the waters, but the pirates also do well with the trade of the town and play nice when they come to town most times. Rothigport is known as a pirate’s haven. The growth spurt of seedy taverns worries the old generation. For adventurers, they go to these locales to hear the stories and perhaps find where the next adventure awaits.  
There are many monsters who lurk in the archipelago but they keep to their own areas and rarely get close to Rothigport. The exception might be the kraken, Regnareeg, who frequents the waters just north of Rothigport.  
Because of the monsters, treasure and other adventures in Song Tide, many adventurers come to Rothigport to get provisions and hear the local rumors.

### There are the 5 Guilds of Rothigport

**Syndic of the Lumberjacks Guild**  
This Guild Is the oldest and most respected even though most foresting has declined in recent years. This industry build this town to what it is today. It is for this reason, and out of respect that stone is not used in building structures. Since the town was originally built out of wood, the strong Guild says that it will always be built out of wood. This tradition has mostly kept going.  
**Syndic of the The Shipbuilders Guild**  
One of the newer guilds that represent the emerging shipbuilders. There are two major shipbuilding companies; the Heneesri Company, House Blacktorn and the Lordiyan Builders, that latter building larger ships but fewer per yul, and the former many, many small ships every yul. This guild is them working together to protect their industry.  
**Syndic of the The Guild of Fishermen**  
An ancient guild of the fisherman, one of the oldest trades in Song Tide and powerful. All the elite in Rothigport belong to it, if only for appearances of supporting an age-honored tradition. This guild helps guard the exports and manage the tariffs.  
**Syndic of the  The Bards Guild**  
The bards are very powerful in Song Tide and commune with the powers of the wailing winds. A bard is a very desirable trait in Song Tide, but only a few are chosen to be in the guild every yul, and only a bard can be in the guild. The guild’s main purpose is to manage the lineage of the bard class and maintain its purity. This is in competition of the Sodality of Bard in Bardtown and much more rigid and systematic, looking to churn out bards to control the tides for fisherman and seafarers and to calm the storms and maelstroms. 

- Song Swellers Lodge, they use the Orinsol Ale to induce song and are very erratic. They don’t belong to any of the Bardic Halls  
- Bards of the Weeping Tide \- part of the Hall of Mischance

The moons have a big effect in the Songtide realm as they control the tides and each has their own type of herbalism and bardsong  
**Syndic of the The Arcanists Guild**  
Song Tide being haven for magic users, must have a guild representing the arcanists. Though most arch mages prefer their solitude in their own tower outside of town, many mages-in-training roam throughout Rothigport but keep a low profile. Magic is assumed to be dead by the Central Kingdoms and beings in Song Tide wish to keep it this way. This guild helps those starting out in this profession to find the necessary resources and tutelage.

There are a number of other organizations in Rothigport such as the recently founded Greenmen’s  Lodge, The Dockstayer’s Lodge

**Blackthorn Brothers**  
Thod and Igmo Blackthorn run the southeast neighborhood (sometimes derogatorily called Blackthornberg) of Rothigport . They are one of the main families in town and commissioned the main big bridge in town on the south bank of the main harbor,  to unite the east and west sides. The bridge is called the **Blackthorn Bridge**. They are vying for prestige in the town against Prigtoon. Their main trade is shipping and secretively smuggling.  
They also have been building a small force to spy on Druvvenrog. This little-known espionage guild is trying to steal information from the industrial guilds there. They currently have trade negotiations with Druvvenrog but have been smuggling goods in and out for many years.  
House Blackthorn’s colors are black and red.  
House Blackthorn’s main industry is shipping and trading. They are the second wealthiest family in Rothigport. The brothers rose up from poverty and living on the streets so they have the support of the working class, but the disdain from the Elites with which they now associate with. Though they try to enact some democratic changes, such as helping the poorer Eastsiders to cross to the wealthier west side, They have built the wealthiest neighborhood in Rothigport which is now experiencing some crime.  
Their support of the working class has helped them to become titled “Protector of the Plebs” a term of endearment and there is a rumor that they will throw their hat in the ring for the next election of the Duke. This has the other elites worried and murmurings of solutions waft through the streets.

The Anti-Tollers  
	Merki Prigtoon has proposed that there be a toll to cross the Blackthorn Bridge, so as to help pay for maintenance of the harbor and the bridges. The bridge is a symbol of equality in the city as it is what united the West Side and the East Side.The West side has been the poorer, working class which is also more religious and superstitious and the East side, though smaller, has the Guild Syndic leaders and town elites.

### Adventures (quests) to be had here:

**Phanasma’s Crypt**  
On the southwest side of Rothigport Port, on its own island is the Prigtoon/Ketapesh Family Mausoleum. Where Prigtoon’s daughter Phanasma, as well as other family members, are interred.

The players find rumors that she was buried with immense amounts of treasure. Phanasma was the sole child of Merkti Prigtoon and his wife Lonsa Prigtoon, of House Ketapesh of Pallamost.  
The Prigtoons are the richest family in Rothigport. Part  (most) of that money comes from the Ketapesh family and their financial interests in Rothigport from the days that House Ketapesh, one of the rival families in Pallamost, moved to Rothigport. One of their ways to keep Rothigport close was to marry one of their daughters to a rising entrepreneur in the vibrant fishing trade of this northern Song Tide region. Merkti was not a good man. He was shrewd and took every opportunity he had to advance his posture in the guilds of Rothigport and became the Syndic of the Fisherman’s Guild, one of the most prestigious posts in Rothigport. He offered many bribes to city officials and took bribes and favors himself. The highest elected official at this time, Percimor, the current Duke, was at odds with Prigtoon and kept him in check.    
Merkti hoped for an offspring so that he could teach them the ways of the markets and profits and to follow in his path and keep the family strong. It took many years, but eventually Lonsa gave birth to Phanasma. To her father’s dismay, she had no interest in industry, but he found her associating with the young magic users in the town. Her fascination with wizardry was something that Merkti did not approve of, as he felt responsible Rothigportians should boost the strength of the city through its economy, and that magic was for either the insane, or the militant.   
Phanasma defended magery and her friends and this caused many fights between her and her father. It hindered his reputation among the guilds, not that other Syndics disliked magery, on the contrary, everyone besides Merkti seemed to be on the side of the mages; but it was because of his torn relationship with his daughter. 

Phanasma would spend days away from home, and with the mages in the countryside, or in the many narrow dockstreets of Rothigport  trying to learn everything she could.

Phanasma became ill at this time of strife with her father. She had acquired Blackrot Blight (The Rot), a terrible, flesh-eating plague that is decimating populations in far off lands (The town of Hawk Finster Hollow). Merkti does not know how she contracted this but he incorrectly assumed it spread among the mage younglings because of their lack of moralsl nonetheless he was forced to quarantine her away on a tiny island near Rothigport. She is the only known case of The Rot in Rothigport so far, but is known to be spreading in other locations across Deluvia. Her personal guard Kervan, also contracted it.  
One day, Phanasma had succumbed to her illness, or so her father and many others thought. In reality, she had disappeared  Her father, Merkti, tried to cover up her disappearance by having a tomb constructed for her in the Ketapesh family catacombs just west of the city. Some townspeople think she was kidnapped. Her father, though he tries to convince everyone else that he believes she has died, has still sent out search parties for her, especially among the magic communities across Songtide, because some part of him does think she was taken away and is still alive.  
Still other devout, believe she was not really entombed but her body exhumed away to another location. 

The players will hear of the riches that are rumored to be interred with Phanasma

The quest begins on the surface, where Greer, the guard will try to deter and defend the entrance.  
The first chamber on the left is the grave of **Miss Katrina Ulvid**  
The second path to the right has Wraiths in the beginning will harass you but do little harm.  
After the wraiths is a room to the left of the crypts of The Cursed Twins, **Liza Gupp** and **Julia Gupp.** around the corner and straight is the crypt of **Phanasma Prigtoon,** and then left and straight until the tomb of **King Joe Havald**

Back starting before the wraith hall  
Up the stairs and To the left and to the left again are the graves of **Jamie Evander** and **Eleanor Evander**  
The second left has the crypt of **Alexander Holdrag** if you go straight, but then to the right is another hallway with a small table with two skulls . If you go straight up the staircase, there is a left to the crypts of **Peter Orin** and **Lyra Orin**, straight to **Randall Orin**, and right will take you to another hallway with a table with two skulls. If you take a right down the stairs and then a right, there is one room on the left for the crypts of **Eris Stonehar**t and **Launa Stonehar**t, then the rest is a dead end.  
 a left from the steps, the first room on the right is the crypt of **Panza**. Further down is a dead end after table and skulls, a left that goes down a hall. A room on the right is the crypts of **Aldis Richmond** and **Lyris Richmond**, and further down that hall way is one last crypt to the left of **Sarun Lassis**

To the left is the crypts of **Richard Lavander** and **Josefine Lavander**

**12 rooms**

1. **Miss Katrina Ulvid**  
2. **Liza Gupp** and **Julia Gupp**

**19 is the largest prime number that is palindromic (something that can be read the same backward as forward) in Roman numerals – XIX.**

**The cursed twins** 

The players will get an item and a clue from each of the crypts. After they visit each crypt each crypt summons an Unburied, which they must fight to get the item. When they defeat the Unbured, the Unburied’s soul can be put to rest.  
they will be able to conjure the **Sedladus** , the old architect of the catacombs and managed the interment of many of the residents; in the final room. He was accidentally sealed upon the completion of the tombs and none of the gravediggers knew what happened to him. He became undead. They must also get the key to the door by fighting the Cursed Twins

The second half of this adventure is a secret cult has taken up residence in further tunnels below the crypts if the players can find them. This cult is the Keepers of the Book of Bones  
The caved-in  old entrance at the bottom. It leads to a very old Ossuary where a cult has taken as their meeting quarters. No one can get through this cave in except through secret ways. The Bone Church, as the stories go, and haunted stories told to Song Tider children to keep them in line, is a humongous cathedral below ground with a labyrinth of tunnels.  
The Bone Church, also designed by Sedladus, made entirely of bone. His designs drove him mad in trying to perfect them, which caused his neglectful passion to complete the project, when his workers accidentally sealed him in. It is said that he completed his design in his remaining starved days etching the blueprint and notes of his masterpiece into the stone floor of the antechamber with his bloody fingernails and until his digits were mere nubs. This glorious tribute would be to **Ossidarius the Bone Father** when finished. It never was, but what was completed is more than adequate for the Keepers of the Book of Bones, who wish to bring Ossidarius back among the pantheon of Song Tide, and even all of Deluvia, if only they can find an architect to finish Sedladus’ vision. His walking corpse may provide some clues, as it haunts the antechamber that is blocked at the bottom of the Rothcrest Crypts.

The players goal in the catacombs could be to get some treasure. There is treasure from the graves, from the monsters, and from Phanasma’s grave.  
They also can find out that

The tomb of the Soldier Kervan  
Kervan was the loyal guard of the Ketapesh House when they first came to Rothigport  
He was fiercely protective of Lonsa as he part of the Pallatian Guard before their disbandment during the dissolution of Pallamost. When Phanasma was born, he guarded her and helped raise her, especially in training her in mastery of arms. When Phanasma was in exile, he was the only one to stay with her to protect her. Prigtoon ordered that he stay at his post to guard the family and its coffers but he insisted that he stay with her. When he contracted “The Rot”, Prigtoon then conceded. When they both succumbed to the illness Kervan was laid not far from Phanasma in the family tomb. His tomb is sealed with a copper lock. The key is located in the the crypt of Kervan’s squire, Panza, his trusty shieldbearer assistant. Panza fell into depression after Kervan’s death and only outlasted him for a few years in solitude and squalor and sour spirits  
Panza lis in unrest as all the corpses in the Crypt do based on the many distress of Phanasma’s ordeal and because of the haunting by Sedladus. Panza wants to help the players get into Kervan’s tomb

Katrina Ulvid’s room:  
I was once the matriarch of a great name,  
A legacy of power, wealth, and fame.  
But now I rest within this tomb,  
A silent memory of my doom.

My family's legacy lives on,  
But my spirit cannot move beyond.  
If you can find the key that's lost,  
My soul will pay the final cost.

The players must find a key

OR

I am a ghost, without a doubt,  
A riddle I have, to figure it out.

What is it that remains when all is done?  
A residue left, after the burning's begun.

It's not quite fire, nor quite soot,  
But a substance that's often overlooked.

Some say it's dark, some say it's white,  
But it's the same substance, day and night.

So tell me, traveler, can you see  
What is the answer to my riddle for thee?

Answer is ASH

What was once alive, now lays still,  
Reduced to remnants of its will.  
A grayish powder, dull and fine,  
What once was bright, has now declined.

ASH

Or 

I am the master of destruction,  
My power is feared by all without exception.  
With a touch I can end a life,  
Or lay waste to everything in sight.  
From the dirt I rise, a force of rage and light,  
Conquering all with my intense might

The cursed twins room:  
Twins we were, but now we're two,  
Cursed to be forever anew.  
Our bones may rest beneath this stone,  
But our spirits roam, forever alone.

Look closely and you'll see our mark,  
A symbol of our eternal dark.  
Find the key to break the curse,  
Or join us in this endless hearse

The answer to this riddle could be a hidden symbol or carving that the adventurers need to find to unlock a secret compartment or door. Alternatively, the key could be a magical amulet or artifact that has the power to break the curse and free the spirits of the twins. The curse itself could be something like a perpetual cycle of death and rebirth or being trapped between worlds, which the adventurers need to unravel in order to break it.

Or 

In life we were as one, inseparable and strong,  
But now in death, we're bound in agony so long.  
Cursed we were by a wicked spell,  
Trapped forever in this dark, dank cell.

Our names once echoed through the halls,  
But now we're just forgotten souls in these walls.  
If you can break the curse that binds us here,  
Our spirits will be free from fear.  
The answer to this riddle could be a series of steps or clues that the adventurers must follow to break the curse on the twins. This could involve finding and using certain objects in the crypt, or performing a specific ritual to break the curse. The curse could be tied to the larger narrative of the puzzle adventure, and the twins may hold some key piece of information or object that the adventurers need to progress.

To break the curse:  
Find the Twins' tombstones in the crypt and light a candle on each one.

Place a lock of hair from each of the twins in a bowl of water, along with a sprig of rosemary and a pinch of salt.

Recite the following incantation:

"By the power of earth, air, fire, and sea,  
Break this curse and set us free.  
Twins cursed in life and death,  
Hear our plea and take a breath.  
Rise up from your darkened tomb,  
And let your spirits leave this room."

Pour the water onto the ground and wait for a sign from the spirits of the Cursed Twins.

If the curse is truly broken, the spirits of the twins should be at peace and may offer some guidance or assistance to the adventurers. If the curse is not broken, the twins may appear in a more menacing form, and the adventurers will have to find another way to escape the crypt.

Objects as the answer to the riddle:

1. Fire  
2. Torch  
3. Stone and dirt  
4. Bottle of Water Bottle of Air  
5. Fish  
6. Ash and coal  
7. Wood  
8. Sword  
9. Leather and Bone  
10. Axe  
11. Compass   
12. Diamond

The truth about The Rot, is that it is plague magic, a type of Death magic, that comes from Wraithwood, The Death Lord, Necromensus, was always jealous of the power his grandchildren received by working with the mortals and of the Fae of the wood

The start of the Rot in the center of Faewood, just north of The Valley of the Moon. Because of the power of the Tree it had to move northward and overtook all it came in contact with.

## The Four Archmages of the Song Tide

The magic lines that run through the are of Deluvia by the Song Tide Archipelago are strong, and it is why the Arch Mages have found their home here for as long as our history was written.  
They are powerful wielders of spells, but they keep their magic to a minimum in the current age, as there are the rumors of Druvenrog’s will to quell the use of magic in all of Deluvia.

### The Emerald Bracelet:

/warp wasteland  
/rg wasteland\_isle

The Mage Ildar **Timistrius** lives in the far off isle known as The Wasteland (aka **Ildaria** when it was beautiful). She is in an awful mood because nothing will grow on her realm.  She believes this is because her magic is waning  and finds out that her gardener is also failing her in his tasks.   
She would like the player to find her a new gardener, or find some new magic that will restore her realm into a lush garden as it once was.  
The player finds out through talking with some Rothigport’s townspeople that **Rinkelspeare**, the faerie trickster of **Rystrilmyl**, out of jealousy, has stolen Timistrius’ gardener, whose songs are the source of the once flourishing gardens growth. The gardener, is a Tree Ent from Fecundia who has been taught in the ways of turgorimancy (*Turgorimancy* in Deluvic, *Life magic* in common tongue),  and knows the sing spell of **Anternacantus**  (*Anternacantus* in Deluvic or *Song Life* in the common tongue) ( a bard spell to cause plants to grow or mega fauna to behave a certain way). The gardener, **Frondo**, sings things song spells while doing his gardening duties, making some of the most wonderful gardens in the realm.

### The Mawg Witch 

**The Mawg Witch** has a hut in the **Rystrilmyl**, and offers tools to help gather the pollen and fruit from the mega flora in Rystrilmyl.  She also instructs the player on how to subdue Mandragor in order to obtain the root.

She will give the player The Charm of Mawg 

### Mandragora

Mandragora is the root beast of the wild lands, The Mandrake Queen. Located to the south of Song Tide she rests underground waiting for fauna to pass by. Her roots sprout little plants that come to the surface that many naturalists seek for their medicinal attributes of pain relief, strength giving and euphoric properties. These plants, which are children of Mandragora, have been highly sought and are rare among Deluvia, because they are found in this one spot, and they are dangerous to gather. If Mandragora awakens, the gatherer will likely be swallowed into the dirt and strangled in her roots.

Ancient rumors exist that she once walked Deluvia with her roots as legs and arms but and distributing strength to all; but was cursed by the waters of Wraithwood which caused her retreat and shriveling back deep into the soil.

Many seekers of magic reagents look for Mandragora’s resting spot for this root. She resists having her children taken away.

There is a temple that worships her in Omphalos, the very center of Deluvia (so called), but she has a particular interest in Rystramyl and has given extra-ordinary imbuement of life force into the tree of Rystralonyan (In the tongue of the Gods, *Drasil* means Magic wood; and *nyan* means Gifted). A faerie-folk, **Rinkelspeare**,  lives in Rystralonyan and is somewhat of a trickster but remains in the favor of Finnwyl. Rystralonyan was gifted by nemistri to Finnwyl, her sister, to solidify their alliance. Finnwyl took pride in the Rastrilonyan Tree, and Rystramyl and bewitched the small area and now mega fauna and mega flora grow there unlike anywhere else in Deluvia.

These flora have pollen that can be gathered by players for all sorts of purposes. Every day these flora appear in new places in Rystrilmyl. They cannot be spawned outside Rystrilmyl.

# Frostwynn Lore 

History About The Lady of the Snow  
In the Age of Gods, Boralumugheil, cast the land in darkness, frost and hibernation to keep his daughter, Embreas from being courted by Necromensus for they were at war with each other. Necromensus and Embreas were still wed and their daughter Freymiss was born to grow and bring the end of the hibernation by killing her grandfather, Boralumugheil. As he lay in her arms, from her grief and guilt she shed a tear that became frozen and as it fell to the frozen ground, broke into three shards. Before Boralumugheil died, his blood fused with the tears passing on some of his power of light and dark. The shards sat on the ground and when the ground melted from the new spring, they each grew into a flower. Freymiss went into exile.  
During the Age of Man, 3 of the 12 Sages, during their wanderings, came across the flowers, and each picked and took one for themselves. When they found their resting place and planted the flowers, they bloomed into women. Each of the 3 women took the 3 Sages for their husband. They were Falthori, Seydna, and Calnora.  
Falthori married The Free Spirit begat Charn, Bristor, Epleyna  
Seydna married The Transformer begat Seritipi, Finnwyl, Nemistri  
Calnora married The Scholar  begat  Malfisis, Dalmisis, Brumisis

From all of these were born the beings that would become the Age of Kings. All the children rose to greatness at some point but it was Seritipi whose realm held over to the age of mortals.

Another note is that Boralumugheil’s wife is Sophgritus comes from the southern jungle lands and is goddess of the winds, which is why her children are now keepers of that trait. Finnwyl, her granddaughter, went to Sophgritus’ homelands and now occupies the Jungle Temple, the center of the world, and where the gods met the first mortals (purportedly by those that live there and follow Finnwyl). Nemistri holds power at the Tree of the Wood, and Finnwyl of the center of Song Tide, but much of their power has been relinquished to the Age of Kings.

Seritipi remains the most powerful of these demi-gods from the North. Nemistri, is a close second, and Finnwyl the third, Seritipi is most powerful because of Frostwyn slows down memory, and by her taking rule there, the memory of the Age of Gods is stronger (less dissipated). 

Current time:

**Seritipi** is The Lady of the Snow. She is part god, part mortal, part witch, part demon. She inherited the blood of her great-grandfather Boralumugheil, whom she wishes to return to greatness. She also has some of the goodness of her grandmother, but some the deviousness of Necromensus in her veins. Her realm was one that was created during the Age of the Gods, but still persists today. In her realm, many of the secrets of the Age of the Gods can be found, as they are frozen in time in fragments throughout Frostwyn. The one area that has been infiltrated is by Bokmal and the Frost Trolls in east Frostwyn, that is to say, this area is not truly under her rule, though probably could be if she willed it enough.

In the beginning part of the quest, the player will learn about the above, and this knowledge will help them gain access to her inner domain, including her fortress, **Mollbrufrost**. Seritipi is not evil nor wants to hurt the players, but would like to seduce them into helping her regain greatness for her lineage; mostly against Necromensus. There are plenty of dangerous events to harm the players in the realm, but Seritipi’s method is to sway them through charm and to enchant them into become part of her Ice Spectre army. She does have plans to rise against Necromensus, her grandfather, since she sides with Boralumugheil and would not mind seeing Necromensus fall down a few pegs, since his power and land is also gaining and becoming a threat to all kingdoms.

### **The main quest of Frostwynn**

### Part I \- The Lore of Frostwynn

The player first learns about The Lady of the Snow from one of the following:  1.) Herrothorg prison, 2.) her sister in the Jungle Temple, 3.) from Bokmal, 4.) nemistri of the Wood or, 5.)  from The Sage The Consumer  
The player must first wander the Frostwyn searching for artifacts in the ice shards which give more tips into the Age of the Gods, which can lead to other quests about the Gods and unlock special power from Gods. 

Her fortress shows up seemingly in different places across Frostwyn each sunrise, so it’s hard for the players to find. The player can happen to stumble upon it, or find the system which it uses to decide where it will appear. It uses the Frost Winds (from which Frostwyn gets it name), as a sort of clock/compass to determine its location. The 8 Winds of the North (The Frost Winds), cross the ice plains in different directions. Each wind is controlled by an old god, one of Boralumugheil children Samaurora (note: Seritipi’s Grandmother), Brumetheus, Tijirimal, Boraminimus, Zruniphor, Tulehadihud,  Drangameen and Sevri, as they blow across the plains their frigid breath. Each takes turns being the most powerful for that day and The Free Spirit Sage has made a clock map to determine the order in which this occurs. There are 32 possible locations The Lady of the Snow’s fortress can appear. Through clues, the player learns of this and then can seek The Free Spirit Sage for the map. This is another free-standing large quest with rewards and perils of its own. The Free Spirit has long since moved far away, so this is a long voyage, but can save the player some time to learn the location of the fortress or they can use luck to randomly find it. They can only enter during the day, between sunrise and sunset, for at night, it is ethereally traveling to its new location.

Frostwyn is a wide and vast ice plain with some ice mountains and boreal forest. It is mostly uninhabited except for the Frost Trolls to the east, and other monsters; and the very south west corner, which was colonized by New Pallamost. New Pallamost had some failed towns there, but now just has a large prison there, called Herrothorg. Through Herrothorg, is the most common way to get to Frostwyn, as once imprisoned there, prisoners will hear about the story of the Lady of the Snow, and why escape is futile, because either the weather will get them, or the Lady of the Snow will freeze them into a pillar of ice. The latter is not true, merely a fable, but keeps the prisoners afraid of escaping (though some of The Lady’s  minions might freeze them\!)  
The reason for her fortress moving randomly is to seek the frozen blood of her great-grandfather, Boralumugheil and use it in a ritual to bring him back and return his greatness back to Frostwynn. She is obsessed with this and keeping the power of Necromensus’ power at a minimum. Before Boralumugheil’s death, during the early part of the Age of the Gods, all of Deluvia was covered in ice by his power for an eon, and when he died, the ice has since retreated to what is now, only Frostwyn.

Rewards to be had before getting to The Lady of the Snow are some wind magic from the 8 gods. There are 8 spells to learn, one from each. The 8 Frost Winds are in the 8 corners of Frostwyn, though not hard to find, they are quite a distance apart.

Samaurora \- unleash freezing gail  
Brumetheus \- the bringer of blizzard   
Tijirimal \- Lord of frostbite  
Boraminimus \- Freezer of souls  
Zruniphor \- The winter bringer  
Tulehadihud \- queen of hail  
Drangameen \- The slower of memories  
Sevri \- Wind of parched chill

Each of these Winds is a mini-dungeon, that must be solved and navigated to find the end Wind god and get one of the spells. Each will give a clue to the player to help find The Free Spirit (now far away) and gain his clock. They will each give a clue to how to solve a certain room in The Lady of the Snow’s fortress.

There are the 14 artifacts embedded in shards of ice that are remnants of the Age of the Gods. Each unlocks some lore and 12 of them unlock a new language fragment to learn the ancient Deluvic language. The 12 Sages each unlock another 12 language fragments, and the remaining 12 are scattered throughout Deluvia. The reason a good portion of them are in Frostwyn, is because this land is mostly untouched and preserved as when the Gods were first humiliated. The Ancient Deluvic is a complicated runic language, but can help the player solve many other ancient riddles in the world, and tap into power words, the clerics can find very useful since it is the language first used by mortals and that which most closely resembles the Tongue of the Gods.  
All 14 of the Frostwynn shards has an artifact of power that can help the player in Deluvia.

Each shard must be brought back to the Great Forge, in the depths of Druvenrog to be melted since they are frozen with frost magic and can only be melted with the heat of the center of Deluvia.  They are scattered around in many different locations and are hard to find, many times, buried deep in the ice.

Three of Lady of the Snow’s cousins have stayed back in Frostwyn (Malfisis, Dalmisis, and Brumisis), and guard 3 of the artifacts and claim to be guardians of them, though they are merely menacing tricksters. The interesting thing is that each of these shards (besides other rewards they give) can be combined into the *Blade* of Abhorrence, well worth the price of dueling these petty demi-demons.

More ice spells can be learned from various casters in Frostwyn. Bokmal and the ice trolls have their own flavor of ice magic that they would be happy to use on the player before teaching it, See that quest.

Various ice weapons, armor and devices can be found. New ice/snow-type monsters can be found to fight. 

The players must learn how to enter the fortress after they learn where it will appear. There is a special key, the Hailstone crystal, which when placed in the headstone of the statue of the Queen of Hail on the eastern edge of the fortress, opens  a gate. The Hailstone crystal lies far to the north on a small island surrounded by frigid waters where the player must solve Brumaltus’ puzzles (another separate quest) and descend into the deep Well of frozen souls to recover Brumaltus’ diamonds.

### Part II \- The Ice Fortress of Mollbrufrost

Once in the Fortress, on the first level there are 8 rooms, one for each of the Winds that the player must solve. If the player has sought the Eight Frost Winds previously. They can use that certain spell and the advice given by the Frost Wind God to solve the room. If the player is not a mage, they get a wand with the spell embedded with a certain amount of charges.

LEVEL 1 \-   
Room 1:  Freeze spell \- the player must manipulate ice columns to get through a maze  
Room 2:  Blizzard spell \- the player causes a blizzard in the room which causes the causes drifts and switches around the contents of the room to open new entrances. This also causes snow blindness to enemies.  
Room 3: Frostbite spell \- withers all mortal (enemy) beings in the room with frost damage  
Room 4: Hibernation spell \- put enemies into long sleep  
Room 5: Bring the solarium to winter, killing the creeping plants  
Room 6: Hail damage to dissolve iron blocks and rearrange room to reveal new secrets  
Room 7: Slowing memory \- This room allows you to alter future levels and the puzzles to come. It also provides a potion of memory slowing which can be given to the Lady’s messenger which can be later used to confuse messages passed from and to The Lady to other kingdoms.  
Room 8: Shatter the ice in the room and lower the temperature, killing all non-frost creatures (including the player if they don’t have Frost protection, they should have some sort of frost protection before entering this room)

LEVEL 2  
Murobrontz, the Snow Laputaur, a miniboss. If they have first met and appeased the Delvwich, she helps fight Murobrontz. Murobrontz is a huge lion head with horse body creature that lives in the snow and helps The Lady keep Frostwyn under her command by doing her bidding. He is weakened by fire damage and further by the Delvwich curse.   
When defeated, Murobrontz drops his battle axe, The **Borastercleave**, which can be picked up, an ancient frost dwarf artifact. Murobrontz also accepts his fate but asks to be slain by his battle axe so that he may enter the afterlife (Halsingreevs, the resting place of frost megafauna warriors) as a true warrior of the Frost winds. If the player accepts and uses the axe, he will put in a good word for the player in Halsingreevs. This blessing opens up quests to imbue Borastercleave with many gems scattered across Deluvia to increase its power. The player can also collect the **Mane of Murobrontz** for later use as a reagent for frost spells.

LEVEL 3

The Courtyard. . . The frozen trophies of The Lady are here. You can unfreeze some to gain extra lore knowledge, but unfreeze the wrong one, they will attack you. At the end are the frozen Knights of Freenbrist, very formidable.

LEVEL 4  
The Frostborn defend  
The ice Spectres are other players who have not quite completed the quest, and failed and were turned into wandering souls. Those players that are online that have turned are made aware of you reaching this level and can come to defend this level. Though they lack physical power, they can all together do a lot of damage. One Ice Spectre can do 1 point of frost damage every 10 seconds, 2, can do 2, 3 can do 4, 4 can do 6, 5 can do 16, 6 can do 32, 7 can do 64 \- 7, 8 can do 128  
This level also has some attunement areas where the player can talk to the Ice Spectres, whereas, in normal game play they can not. This allows the Spectres to either lure the player into their ranks, or haunt the player with words. The player must simply get through. If no Ice Spectres are online, this will be simple. This area gets more difficult as time goes on in the world timeline.

LEVEL 5

This is the court of the 5 Frost Goblin Princes. Here the player learns more lore about the Goblin race which to that lore quest and how the 5 Princes were each given as tribute to The Lady from the Goblin King, Aleighgazor who now resides in Gozon, Druvenrog.  
Each court room guards one of 5 possible random entrances to the next level. The other four lead to a maze. Unless they choose the correct answer to the riddle, they are not given the right gate and must randomly choose.  
**Miniztron** \- Goblin Prince 1: Maze of Insanity. The player must choose the right combination to get out and then they are dumped out at Level 4\. The player can get the **Gear of Truth** artifact here  
**Fozgorn** \- Goblin Prince 2: Maze of Paranoia. The player’s misdeeds are broadcast to Frostwyn. The player is then dumped out in Bokmal’s land. The player can get the **Valve of Sanity**  
**Prizlin** \- Goblin Prince 3: Maze of Chaos. The maze is constantly shifting in random order to then be dumped out at the entrance to Hythlodaeus’ domain. The player can get the **Axle of Order**  
**Moffgo** \-  Goblin Prince 4: Maze of Deception. Invisible walls and traps. The player can get the **Lense of Candor.** The player is dumped out at the Goblin Atoll.  
**Sinerzip** \- Goblin Prince 5: Maze of Delusion. Player is brought close to the end of the fortress and can see The Lady of the Snow, but then is dumped out at the entrance. The player can get the **Sextant of Reality**.

From each of the mazes the player can find 2 artifact ruins per maze to decipher the Goblin language.

All of the above rewards can be used to bring back to Gozon and combined to form an ultimate **Automaton with Aleighgazor**. The player can only get one of the artifacts from this quest, so they must find the other parts through other means, such as buying or stealing from other players that have them. The second time through the court rooms, after an artifact is found, the rest are removed as an option, but the hardships still remain.  
If the player guesses the riddle correctly, they will go directly to level 6\. The riddle has to do with Goblin lore, so the player is encouraged to study up by finding the other Goblin refugees across Deluvia before starting this level.

LEVEL 6

The outer chambers. The player begins their temptation down the path of Ice Spectre. They are presented with 10 entrances, one of which is correct. The others are one-way paths out to the wilderness of Frostwyn. In the correct path leads to an open field with 3 icy mastadons which charge down the player. The player must slay them and then enter another room with the mastadon’s keeper, **Mammrooth**. After chiding the player for killing his pets he gives the player an option of 3 doors to enter. They can choose one and when they do, Mammrooth opens one of the wrong doors that leads to the entrance of the fortress. He asks if the player wants to change their answer. If they don’t he fights the player. When he is finally is defeated, before he dies, he offers the key to the right door if the player spares his life, otherwise the key dies with him. If they kill him, they get the skill of mastadon taming but then can never complete the quest. If they  leave him alive, they can get the right door, but Mammrooth will come back later to taunt them.

LEVEL 7 

The Lady of the Snow is waiting on the other side of the door. She is magnificent but frightful in all her icy glory. She asks why the player hadn’t killed Mammrooth and says there will be another chance. She is testing the player. She says she needs a force to raid the dark fiery domain of Necromensus and can offer much power to the player in exchange for their help. If the player has already obtained The Blade of Abhorrence she will enchant it with the cold vortex ability if the player take the path to become part of her army.  
If the player takes the other path, she is mad and leaves the player in the room with snow golems to tend with. 

LEVEL 8   
If the player defeats the snow golems they proceed to part 4 (this eventually leads them out of the quest, never able to complete it. They should have gotten enough treasure and skills to be content )  
If the player agrees to the dark path, they proceed to part 3 with the eventual possibility to complete the whole quest.

### Part 3 \- The Frostborn

The player accepts The Lady of the Snow’s invitation to become a Frostborn, one of her army of Ice Spectres. This army consists of all other players that have come this far. It is a difficult path to finish becoming one, but even more difficult to undo this pact. There are only two known ways to undo becoming a Frostborn; one is to undergo the unborn quest which is the most difficult way (and is the completion of the quest- Part 5), or have a player that is among the corporeal realm go through the quest free all the Frostborn. (this is another epic quest for a player as well).

Whatever class that player has at this point is abandoned and they achieve the class of Frostborn, which is a combination of a frost mage and a death mage, with some unique spells and abilities mixed in.

One ability is to be able to go into ethereal form. This allows them to be invisible to mortals and able to go through solid objects. At first they can only go into this form for short periods, but the more they use this ability, the more it randomly happens to them, until eventually the player is always in this form forever. They are unable to hold physical objects in this form (except for special frost weapons such as the Sword of Abhorrence), but will gain new spells that can be used while in this form. This opens up a whole new world for the player, but also closes down a whole world.

Other restrictions are that The Lady expects you to spend much of your time in Frostwyn. She expects you to come to her aid when beckoned, and she will expect you to train for and participate in the epic battle she has planned with Necromensus and his minions when the time is right. 

The Lady of the Snow has more communication with her acolytes than most deities, especially when her powers are heightened while in Frostwyn.

If a Frostborn goes absent, they may get hunted down by the rest of the Frostborn army which is their duty to do so. AWOL Frostborn are flagged and other Frostborn that capture them, gain extra XP.

TASK 1  
The Tears of Freymiss  
Where Freymiss’ tears fell is marked in the souls of the Frostborn and are their first pilgrimage.  
There are still remnants of her frozen tears here, which never melted and which, when gathered, become the soul of a Frostborn. They must go retrieve one to start receiving their power. When gathered they bring it back to the altar behind The Lady of the Snow’s throne room for a ritual to convert the player to a Frostborn.  
Before the ritual is over, The Lady binds the player to kill either a follower of The Free Spirit Sage, or The Scholar Sage, as she sees them as competition and defilers of the original tears and flowers her sisters and cousins were born from. The player gets access to one new frost spell for each follower they kill and bring the head back to The Lady. Only one is necessary to move onto the next task.

TASK 2  
The Scouting of Doomforge  
Doomforge is the domain of Necromensus and on the opposite end of the world. It is easier for the player to do this while they still retain some corporeal power, as they can use transportation means of mortals to get there. If they haven’t been there before, getting there and finding it is a quest on its own. When the player does finally get there, their ethereal form ability gets lengthened from 5 seconds per day, to 10\. This is pure roleplaying and The Lady only expects whatever information the spectre can and is willing to provide.

TASK 3   
Kill an ice troll warlord.   
Infiltrate Bokmal’s domain to the east in Frostwyn. The player finds an encampment. Once there, they receive an upgrade to their ethereal ability to 20 seconds a day and the spell to call a frost dire wolf to their aid.  
There is much conversation with the warlord and he tries to convince the player of the curse they have with The Lady of the Snow and it would be much better to join the trolls against the gods and learn their own type of shamanic ice magic. The player is given the choice. If they continue the battle with the warlord, they get the **Talisman of Brigningrod**, which gives the highest amount of frost magic protection.   
The player then will start to get weakened physical characteristics but also has the ability to go into ethereal mode twice a day for 20 seconds each. The player is now put onto Bokmal’s enemy list.

TASK 4  
Haunting of Herrothorg  
Herrothorg, the ice prison is a terrible place for prisoners. One of the reasons is the rumors that they are spooked by ghosts. These not just rumors but actually the Frostborn. Herrothorg is a prison colony of New Pallamost, and The Lady despises the ambitious humans. For this she expects her minions to make trouble for the guards and prisoners there. Once they arrive they get \+10 seconds added to their ethereal form, but they will intermittently go in and out of ethereal form if they are in corporeal form.  They also get the spell of **telekinesis**, to move objects that are far away. \<more info needed  here as to how they haunt\>

TASK 5  
Gathering of Frizwhils  
Frizwhils is an old Frostborn general who calls the Gathering to further initiate the acolytes. They are presented with a new spell, **Mullbrufrost Recall**, which allows them to return to Mullbrufrost entrance in an instant. They are given the **Ice Pike** dagger which deals frost damage. Frizwhils explains more about their missions and the player can meet other Frostborn.   
Frizwhils also takes away their corporeal form and they are permanently in ethereal form. Since all Frostborn come to this, it only happens at certain intervals, (once per week?), so the player must find other things to do if they are waiting for this to move onto the next task. The player also gets their own dwelling in the Caves of Griffmourne, a world that normal corporal players cannot get to. In this world, the Frostborn can build freely.  
   
TASK 6  
Maintenance of Mullbrufrost  
The Lady’s fortress needs some expansion and repair. This is also in preparation of a potential invasion by Necromensus. Though Necromensus has much more on his mind, and other goals and enemies, The Lady does feel like he may raid her fortress just to spite her. She is paranoid and hates him, but it is possible.  (Necromensus has a similar acolyte system which makes them mortal enemies of the Frostborn and locked in eventual ethereal battle). The player gets some building ability with certain frost blocks. Frizwhils also directs which areas need to be built. This task gets the player acquainted with the potential war with Necromensus’s empire. This also allows them to now build upon their plot in Griffmourne.

TASK 7  
The Snuffing of the Great Forge  
The Lady does not like questors stealing her artifacts and thawing them and she has it out for Druvenrog and their Great Forge. Fozgorn, one of the Frost Goblin Princes will guide you to Gozon and introduce you to Aleighgazor, the Goblin King. Once here the player will get 10 seconds back that they can choose to go into corporeal form.

Aleighgazor tries to convince you to help him unite all the Goblins in one nation, as they are now spread across the world. This would entail Aleighgazor retracting his tribute of the 5 Princes to The Lady, but in return, he will help her destroy the Great Forge. This ends up becoming its own large quest that a group of players can complete. (Uniting the Goblins is also a large quest.) Once complete, the Great Forge is done, altering the nature of the world.  Once this quest is complete, it is removed from the Frostborn tasks.

TASK 8  
Kidnap one of Necromensus’ 5 daughters  
The Frostborn player is sent again to Doomforge. The Lady of the Snow wants as her captive one, or all of Necromensus’ daughters. They are his most prized possessions so this is difficult.  
She desires this to bring Necromensus to her domain to fight the epic battle, where she will hav e home field advantage of her frost spells and beasts.  
It should be said only 5 players can complete this; perhaps less, as during their quest during the capture or on the return could result in an alternative ending. The final spell is lanumagicor  a teleportation skill to 8 locations across Deluvia

Once these 8 tasks are complete, the player is then pure Frostborn with at least 16 frost spells, invisibility and ability to go through walls, and the ability to instantly teleport to the  locations.  
They now train and do the Lady of the Snow’s bidding in waiting for the epic war against Necromensus.

### Ozymandius

Ozymandius is the lizard king/god on the large equatorial island of Strifftrat Major and the leader of the lizardmen pirates. The lizardmen roam the islands in that region and operate a kidnapping syndicate, where ransom coin is their main source of income. Most captains avoid this small region, as there is little reason to go here anyway.

Ozymandius gained his position through his leadership, vicious prowess in raiding, and most importantly, his immense size. His ancestors have ruled the lizards as a divine right as a demigod. Their culture has it that once signs of aging begin, however, that is a sign that his reign is over, and the lizard people perform regicide and feast on his flesh. This has fostered a tradition of the latest king investing heavily in anti-aging methods to hold onto his throne as long as he can, and delay his demise.

Ozymandius's son Pryomandius, wait for the regicidal Day of Dyziat where he can eat the flesh of his father and take up his throne and rule.

Ozymandius is 1042 years old.

### Brumaltas

The snow beast of the North is Brumaltas. This creature made entirely of snow and held together by frost magic will toss icy snowballs at travelers causing great pain. He makes an appearance on one of the Northern Isle during mid winter and offers unique treasures.

There is one way to defeat Brumaltas and if you haven't guessed it, then you best stay back in Endergeddon Spawn area.

### Bokmal

The chief of a band of frost trolls in the far north that prey off of the occasional traveler searching for the Northern Passage. This band of frost trolls is different in that they have their own written language and are literate, something that Bokmal is proud of. He has secret ambitions to make a nation that trades with the rest of the nation-states of Deluvia, though this is far off

### Lych Lords of Wraithwood

The Lych Lord has lived eons without knowledge of what goes on with the passage of time above. He rules his ancient mausoleum that is deep below the Wraithwood and remains agnostic from the troubles in the overland he once had domain over.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis path into necromancy is unknown as the tomes of this lore are buried in his library. Scholars seek this \<strong\>Necronomicon Library\</strong\> as it would open up knowledge of an undocumented history of the Second Age of when the Lych Lord was once ruler. Adventurers seek his lair for fame and fortune. Followers of necromancy seek the \<strong\>Phylacteron\</strong\>, the amulet that is the source of his power that keeps him animated and powerful enough to defy death. In fact he cannot be killed simply by running him through with a sword of any kind, but by draining his source.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow this corpse of a king walks in shrouds among his undead minions and lonely souls soaking in the deathly powers of the Wraithwood hollows, mostly content to be left alone. He sits on his throne of bones with pallid skin, black hands and sunken anemic face upon which sits his crown. He once rode among the other Undead kings on his pale stead \<strong\>Thaumalatus \</strong\>bringing dread and pestilence to all living things. After the Wars of the Third Age he has retreated to his halls to haunt only those that come close. And coming close is difficult indeed, as the entrance to this lychgate is small and nondescript among the gnarled trees, deep in the Wraithwood. Tellers of tales say that travelers can hear the rumbled playing  of macabre dirges on his pipe organ deep in the putrid soil sending miserable vibes outward.

Artifact: Crown of the Five Kings ( a crown with 5 spikes)

### Saughill Mist

The Observatory of Saughill Mist has been a pilgrimage of many astrologers over the ages. Located in the Riftlands they keep watch over the night skies. This tight-knit brotherhood of astrologers only approve new members when the Red and White moons align. Travelers are always welcomed and offered refuge from the cold winds, if one is able to make it up the thousand step walk to their high outcrop. They will not spill their secrets readily. Their allegiance was once to New Pallamost for whom they were advisors, but that was before the Wars.Now they watch and prophesy only for themselves.  
The Fraternity's main circle is astrology, though they do keep alchemists and enchanters in their midst, for hand-crafting potions and enchantments based upon their astrological knowledge, but all for the solitary goal of watching above and making predictions of things to come. This is also one of the few places to view the kingdoms of Kapasia, the floating land masses above.

Hollow Grove Guardian

# The History of New Pallamost  (The Old Order)

The history of New Pallamost is as old as the Third Age. When the Age of Gods ended and The Age of Men rose one of the Twelve Sages,  The Sage The Cleric came upon the land that he found good. He set up a shrine to Pallas, son of Sifaneus of the Deluvic faith. Over the years, pilgrims would come to this island of Pallamost (meaning *Greatest Pallatia* ) and a town was founded. The Sage The Cleric then left to find more mysteries of Deluvia, where Kaln Azernath, one of the founding pilgrims built the town that would now be called Pallamost.   
The Pallatian Clerics, some of the most devout pilgrims founded their order and are now known to be the oldest order in Deluvia.  
Pallamost grew quickly, as the beings known as men were able to replicate much and generations changed quickly. Kaln’s grave is still in the main cemetery, and each of his descendants would reign as a king. Kaln would be known, retroactively, as the first Azernath King. 

Here is a list of events in the the Azernath Dynasty

The 12 Sages, of which I am one, were birthed from the Omphalos, straight out of that gash in Deluvia and spread in 12 directions. The Sages procreated with the children of Gods and some of their children were demigods, and others were mortals. It was Sage \- The Cleric, that came upon the mountain of Keed and met the god Pallas. There she progenerated with Pallas and all of their children were Pallatian and founded the city of Pallamost. It was many januul before it was Kaln Azernath, the devout pilgrim, that started the Pallatian Order and became the first Pallatian King.

* His son, Tillik Azernath II inherited the kingdom. The cathedral finishes the central dome, the Festival of Dolstide is established to celebrate all that is great about Pallas and Pallamost and the nearly finished cathedral. He labels himself as "He who grasps the world", and invests in the spiritual realm and art over the temporal realm.  
* His son, Kaln Azernath V inherited the kingdom. The cathedral is considered complete and the Grand Tourney of Deluvia is established as part of the Festival of Dolstide. Pallamost is considered the capital of Deluvia, though most of the Outer Rim do not recognize this.  
* His son, Xandrius inherited the kingdom.  The Battle of Brinsbik starts when the colony revolts and Xandrius  dispels the rebellion with the force of The Legion and an army of mages.

  This new colony of Druvenrog allies with their old oppressor Pallamost  
* Jom Azernath IV \- The Great Deluge occurs setting the world in upheaval and half under water. 90% of the kingdom is underwater and only the mountain top, luckily where the kingdom castle and cathedral are, is saved. Most Pallamostans leave upon the Long Sea to escape. This also puts a temporary end to the War. The city is now called New Pallamost to indicate this new era.

New threats from The Outer Rim, Demons, Gargoyles, Druvenrog and others are pressuring the queen. The Bellafroks want the throne, Jom Azernath IV’s grandson wants the throne, and other outside upstarts also do. The King’s court has a lot to contend with and this is the current time of Deluvia.

New Pallamost is the capital city of Deluvia. This term only meant something in ages past and currently, and though many regard the city for its former glory, the seat of rule is currently nowhere.  Power waned after the Wars of the Third Age (The Deluvian Wars) due to many factors, but one being the loss of free labor through Gargoyle enslavement (their freedom being granted through the Truce of Gurgulalon, the armistice to end the war). The rising seas also caused much loss of land for them driving them back to the islands they currently inhabit. Mainly, they have not kept up on technological research and are resting on their laurels of what they consider their "right" to rule by inheritance from the gods.  
They follow their patron demi-god Pallatia, the hero of the Gigantomachian Ballads, an epic poem. Pallatia is a son of Sifaneus of the Deluvic Faith. The Temple to Pallatia, is a one of the largest in the realm, meant to impress all pilgrims to this region. Every year, on the Queen's birthday, which coincides with the lining up of the season of Dolstide, there is the Festivus Drans Pallatia, which Pallatia's battle is reenacted and the children dress as the young Pallatia. The newest members are knighted to the Pallatian Court on this day and the Queen's Grand Tournament is held. For this whole week the city is enlivened with celebration.  
New Pallamost still holds the judicial seat of the Central Kingdoms region and the Independent Kingdoms occasionally bring matters to the court. The central banking system for the realm is here, the best art galleries, museums and gardens can be perused. There is still a vibrant industry, though they are quickly losing out to House Storm King.  
They still like to speak of the years of glory and the grandeur they once had. The Queen Redfayne Joyzil speaks of his victorious battles of the past to anyone that comes to listen in his court, but the waning Queen is reduced to little more than puppet government for a once, vast kingdom and powerful Lord. Most will admit the technocrats of the Northern Islands now compete for power. He rules as head of his Pallatian Court, 12 elite warrior kings from certain rigid bloodlines. Much of the land holdings of the court had be lost after the wars. Their border shrinks daily.  
Queen Redfayne assumed control of the realm when her King, Dux Joyzil died in the wars of the Third Age. Many thought her kingdom would crumble. She has managed to keep control with the help of her court.  
Despite this, New Pallamost remains the culture hub of the central kingdoms and most any good or service can be bought and desire met; passage to any port can be found and people and entertainment of most varieties located.  
Points of interest are the docks where the shipyards lie. Goods are constantly being shipped in and out, by sea and by the new mode of transportation: air. The market is one of the best for the variety and luxury of goods. The restaurants and taverns are the talk of Deluvia. The Queen's Palace is not to be missed. The [Grand Tournament](http://steamfront.net/deluvia-grand-tourney/) is held each year as part of the Festival of Dolstide  and The Queen awards a coveted prize. A gargoyle statue, gifted by the Gargoyles as a peace tribute is on view. The Library of Xandris the largest collection of knowledge and scholars to be sought. The Temple of Pallamost is where the Queen's Champion is awarded at the Festival of Dolstide. The temple is also the destination of many pilgrims of the Paladin Aura. There are parks and gardens and much for travelers to see.

### Pallamost

(Note: this is taken out of the game for now and will be added in as a second coming)  
City Name: New Pallamost.  
Greater Area: A scattering of islands around the main island of New Pallamost which are uninhabited at this writing.  
Industry: Most everything since this city is so large. Politics, education, warcraft.   
There is a demand for most things if you look because most everyone comes through here.  
City personality: Most people are in good cheer and happy and inviting. After the Wars of the Third Age, everyone feels on top. This is a bit naive and Pollyanna-ish as many of the problems that existed before the Wars are still here and new problems have developed. New Pallamost was the most powerful realm before the Wars. They no longer are. Either Druvenrog or the Demons are. Since the Demons are in seclusion no one in the Central Kingdoms knows their power. Druvenrog has many secrets as they are investing in new technologies such as airships and the Ichor from the Deep. Their newest idea is to pump Ichor from the Deep into huge mechanized Golems. Part machine, part blood of Deluvia herself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\&nbsp;\\r\\n\<h1\>History:\</h1\>\\r\\nNew Pallamost was founded early on in the Third Age by the Elder Sage, The Leader. The Leader Sage set the King Greymayne as the ruler and his descendant still rules as House Pallamost.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey follow their patron demi-god Pallatia, the hero of the Gigantomallian Ballads, an epic poem. Pallatia is a son of Sifaneus of the Deluvic Faith. The Elder Sage, The Cleric had founded the Temple to Pallatia, on the southern tip of New Pallamost.\\r\\n\\r\\nNew Pallamost is unique in that it has two of the Twelve Sages involved in its origin.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe island that The Leader had found originally had no name. When The Cleric came shortly after, he named the island New Pallamost after Pallatia and His old dwelling grounds far to the west from which he had been exiled.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current King in power of House Pallamost is King Greymayne XXV since he is the twenty-fifth descendant of the first Greymayne put in power by The Leader. The Leader and The Cleric are far gone now. They left after helping the first Greymayne establish his realm. They have gone into hermitage into the far reaches of Deluvia.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Wars of the Third Age started under Greymayne VI. King Greymayne XXV is the ruler for which peace is established.\\r\\n\<h1\>Quests:\</h1\>\\r\\nKill endermites in sewers (10) \- independent\\r\\n\\r\\nCult of the Outcast \- part of larger quest\\r\\n\<p style=\\"padding-left: 30px;\\"\>The Cult of the Outcast lives in the the sewer hub of New Pallamost. They are descendants of the first Council to Greymayne. Greymayne I had taken on a Council of Abloyant, a people that could see into the future. Once these advisors had told him that New Pallamost would end in ruin, he had them exiled from the island.

They are a 6000 page poem, in 12 volumes of how Pallatia was an integral part in defeating the Titan Gods in the Second Age. Most every New Pallamostian knows some key lines, very few have the patience to read the whole thing. Everyone knows they are important to the values of the realm and has respect. The Twelve Pallatian Proctors guard the original copy of the manuscript and are charged with studying and interpreting it. The Twelve help in administering the recitation, which is sung by the chorus every year. The Ballads were set to music 17 years ago by he who is known as Theophany, the court composer. This has enlivened the festivities since, and caused for more interest in their study. Theophany is considered one of the greatest composers in the Third Age and to create a 24 hour Magnus Opus such as this was no small feat.\</p\>\\r\\n\<p style=\\"padding-left: 30px;\\"\>The contents of the Ballads are about a class of titans clad in iron and as tall as the clocktower rising out of the Eastern Seas to destroy the gods.

It really is a history of the Second Age, though there are other supporting documents. This makes the Twelve Pallatian Proctors experts in this period.

# Other Kingdoms

### Cult of the Holy Dread

There are many vile and horrible things in Deluvia, but one is the rising influence of the Cult of the Holy Dread.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey reside in the outcast camps far in the edges of the southern lands but no one knows for sure. Any troops sent to return with their bounty has never come back. The Troops could have been lost to the Cliffs of Sangor, for which many believe you must sail through to find their encampment, inducted into the Cult's ranks, or slaughtered by them.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne reason they are so despised is that they lure in the young men of Deluvia promising power and fortune, but their religion is a deceptive one. Once they have brainwashed a new acolyte, they have become part of the brain-, hive-minded, bloodlust horde that raids ships with menacing force. If only they didn\\'t have some sway and influence in their messaging to gain new followers.\\r\\n\\r\\nStay tuned to this post to know more of their dreadful acts committed in the dank bowels of their hideout. If this reporter can continue to send out missives without being caught, we can expose them and hunt them down.

### Hythlodaeus.

Meet Hythlodaeus. Or maybe you would rather not as he is the ruler of a small domain among the Southern Islands where hostility and destruction abound and everything is turned on its head.  
His labyrinthine underground keep is where he's spent the last 3000 years setting traps and malevolent puzzles for any traveler coming to greet him.  
This trickster, the annals say, was responsible for pitting the dragons against each other and starting the Great Deluge for which our world is known. It is For this great and honorable warriors sought revenge. None have been heard from again.  
Other, more industrious rogues, have sought to steal his **ammulekrom**, the secret nonsense language which is the source for his chaotic powers.  
His child is the beast Zalrumurlith which guards over the Tantalon Remis Stone Temple of Despise.

Forming an army to march on Frostwynn and imprison Seritipi, Finnwyl, Nemistri  
They are building an arsenal of iron, for they know that cold iron burns Nemistri and her offspring of the Faerie folk. They will use the fire of their great forge to melt Seritipi’s fortress, Mullbrufrost and the land of Frostwynn.   
Necromensus as his wife, Embreas are building up their powers to return the gods back to their once greatness.

### Crimson Patriarch of the Duravian Empire,

Long before he was the Crimson Patriarch of the Duravian Empire, Ren\\'Aroz was known as Renwald the Rogue. Or, rather, he had hoped he would be considered as such, but Renwald was not per say the best at what he did. Born into an elvish family of hunters, Renwald was likely the least useful. His talents as a silver tongue and a proper communicator was all but wasted on those who considered silence and the shadows as their only ways to survive. When asked of his time before finding Necromensus, he would often laugh about it, shrugging it off like it was simply another life. And, when asked how he found his calling as a demon, he often regales the commoner with a well spun tale, that goes something like this.\\n\\n\\"It was a warm spring night, the entire clan was out either hunting or gathering for the large feast to be held at sunrise. I was tasked, along with many of my bretherin, to bring back a stag, or deer; something to appease the elders. However, I was never one for hunting exactly, and I was probably more likely to end up shooting a friend or relative crouching in a bush faster than I\\'d be able to hit a moving deer. In fact, and I'm not exactly proud of this, but I can honestly say, once or twice I almost did. But, this night was a little different. I had wandered perhaps very far from my village, and found myself lost way beyond recognition. I tried looking around for my village, and at the first sign of light and life, I sprinted towards it, barely missing several bear traps also hidden amongst the brush. What I came upon was not my village, but rather a glowing shrine, one of which I've only heard about among my tribes various legends. Of course I went towards it, and the second I touched it, everything came to life. The large dark stone circle standing resolute and cold in the dark woods, began to resonate with an eerie purple hue. I wanted to step back, but I heard a voice calling from beyond the void, ebbing me towards it. Against my better judgement, though I know now it was the best decision of my life, I ended up walking right into it. After several splitting headaches, a new voice in my mind and in my heart, and a mind boggling transformation that began at my head, and ended with a new tail, I eventually wandered back to my village, to be quickly chased out as some sort of invader. After all that madness, I sought answers starting with that shrine. Something in my mind guided me back to it and that lead to my first correspondence with Necromensus. He told me about demon culture, how my new life was there, blah blah blah, and he told me to step through his dimension, to come through into a strong colony that needed a voice. So, that's how I got here, in Duravia.\\"\\n\\nAfter reaching his new home, greeted by his fellow demons, he quickly found his talent put to use as Necromensus had said. Ren\\'Aroz, as his ember told him to be called now, quickly aided him in rising up the ranks of the political forces in the growing underground demon coven. Though many demons Patriarchs have come to power with the knowledge of war, and glory from many battles, Ren\\'Aroz has managed to maintain peace, and continues to grow his colony into an empire: The Duravian Empire. Those under his peaceful reign have come to call him the Silver Patriarch, a master in the art of speech, and hopefully a cornerstone in the growing following of demons.\\n\<ul\>\\n 	\<li\>Race: Demon\</li\>\\n 	\<li\>Subrace: Elf\</li\>\\n 	\<li\>Class: Patriarch (administration)\</li\>\\n 	\<li\>Allegiance: The Duravian Empire\</li\>\\n 	\<li\>Location: Deep below the Riftlands\</li\>\\n 	\<li\>Skills: Speech, lore, history, foreign relations\</li\>\\n\</ul\>', 'Character: Ren\\'Aroz The Silver Patriarch'

# The History of the Kingdom of the Wood

The Kingdom of the Wood, is a realm that time forgot, and is still imbued with much of the manifestation of the Gods and Goddesses. Rich with mega flora and fauna, the waters teem with life, and the soils are abundant and fertile.

The faerie-folk and ents were the first to inhabit this region, but after the expulsion from the torrential Deluge, many new refugees have come seeking shelter under the great tree, **Drasilissigeaunt**. This tree, which was a gift to the faerie-demigod, King of the Wood, when he was young, as a wedding gift from his mother, Nemistri, one of the great goddesses of old. The rich spring in which he planted the sapling, caused it to grow high and strong over the eons. ncThe faerie-folk and ents built their civilization in the branches of this ancient Sylvan Oak. 

The blessing of Nemistri have kept this realm sacred and protected for so long, that the citizens feel safe and are unaware of the Rotwood Blight  creeping out of the Corrupted Wraithwood, their close neighbor.

Most of the Kingdom of the Wood is wild. Their existence is bounded by the wilderness, by the unyielding darkness of ancient woods. Most of the Wood is the place where most beings are not supposed to be, and dangerous to most. It is natural and it is free. The forest hid all manner of danger, but it is where he had to roam. The trees can hide more than deadly creatures and lawless men however, magic and madness can lie in wait, shall we ever stray too far from the path. 

## Urd Drasil

Another realm that is quite influential that goes back to the beginning of the Age of Mortals is The Kingdom of the Wood. The Wood, is where the goddess Nemistri settled. She is half god, half mortal but is still one of the most powerful deities in Deluvia. The Wood is steeped in magic and most all of its inhabitants practice magery to some degree. 

Nemistri has given the day-to-day ruling of The Wood, particularly the center region, called Fecundia, to her son, Urd Drasil so that she can about keeping magic intact in her realm while magic is under threat. Urd Drasil's father, **Rattelhob**, another demigod, gifted a pet to Urd Drasil, The **Therion Stag**, what become a large megolosaurus giganteus, that is one of the mega fauna that gives Fecundia is power of growth and fertility. 

In the center of Fecundia is also the well of **Aqua Vitae**, the magical waters the flow below Fecundia and give it most of its fertile powers. This well, called the **well of Faenkra**, is the access point to the waters and is ruled over by Urd Drasil.

When Urd Drasil chose a mate, he chose a human mortal from the town of **Rivenward (Gwelftshire)**, just down the hill from the Well of Fenkra. As a wedding gift, Nemistri gifted Urd Drasil, and his new wife, Yore, a golden sapling called Drasil. You see, *Drasil* means Wood in the old Deluvic tongue. *Urd* means Ruler, so Urd Drasil's name is the mortal tongue literally means Wood King. 

Because Yore drank from Faenkra, she outlived all of her mortal family and counterparts, and Drasil grew to be hundreds of feet tall and the home to Urd Drasil and his court. The mortal town of Rivenward regarded Yore very highly, since she was born there and each januul had a festival called Yore's Festival, in which she always tried to attend. Urd Drasil was jealous of the affection the town gave her and kept her locked in the top of the Great Tree Drasil, the God Treee. He expected all of the praise from the mortals in Fecundia for himself.

It was one januul during Yore's Festival that Yore had hanged herself from her neck from the highest branch of Drasil because of the sorrow of being separated from her people, and the petty jealousy of her husband. When the people of Rivenward found about this they started to hate UrdDrasil and a dark cloud hung over Rivenward and much of Fecundia. People referred to the Great Tree Drasil as (Yorishwood) Yore's Gallow from then on.

In Fecundia, the residents desire to stay in touch with ***Asil***, the spiritual energy of a particular place or member of nature. Asil can be translated to Nature Spririts.

Faendrasi translates into the “The Way of the Nature Spirits”

To them the fox is the messenger spirit of Nemistri. Purification is a prime aspect of all rituals in Faendrasi religion. It exists to find balance between nature and the races and the gods. This counteracts the effects of pollution, which is considered an obstruction to the flow of life and the blessing from the Asil.

The residents of Faekundia are called **Kunddrasil**, *Kund* meaning child and *Drasil* meaning wood. They are Children of the Wood

The Asil also love music and to be entertained. The bard class has many songspells that work to bring favor from the Asil. Music can be used to speak to the spirits of the forest.

The three key aspects of Fecunda are Balance, Purity and Transformation

Other things:

The Wolf Walkers are a druid clan in Fecundia

**Drasilissigeaunt** is located in the region called **The Valley of the Moon**. (Mynith Vale) The old goddess Meena, guarded the valley for millenia, until she took part in the Wars of the Second Age, and she has not been seen since. She had blessed Nemistri to be the guardian of the Mynith Vale until her return., part of Faekundia where the waters lead. A path leads down into the valley on it’s north side from other small towns and winds through the heath and approaching Drasillissigeaunt from the north, crossing the River Sylvene and up to the Elden Gate.   
Drasil is home to many races, and refuge to The Faefolk, which inhabit the interior of the truck, inside the branches and upon the branches.

The **River Mnimimor** flows through the center of this land and around the tree and holds the memories of this land.

The FaeFolk are a divine proto-species. They are all children of Nemistri and followers of the moon.

There are other Asil such as the Bark Spirit, Giddy, Ore Scamper, Tilly Hod that are considered Fauna but they live in the the grassy areas 

Once one enters the Elden Gate, they enter the many towns of the Drasil. The core of the civilization of the Faefolk. The moons give power from above, and the Faenkra fountain gives power from below. All of the Fae in Drasil live in harmony and with and among each other, but there are certain Districts and some have different percentage of habitants.

The first level or Thenchrios is a market district. The path from the Elden gate goes south and is flanked by shops of magic trinkets, bakeries, flower shops. Metal objects, are forbidden in The Faewood, and they corrode and rust almost immediately. Wood armor and weapons are fine. The Faefolk are powerful magic wielders, so conventional weapons are not that common, but a few shops of weapons and armor might be found, as some Anthorans have found their home in Drasil and deal in such goods.    
After going south for a bit, the path goes left and right. The leftward way leads to Underthenchrios, and the Fabbersgrin Alley to the east and Morelinn Lanes, down paths to the west.  This beginning area of Thenchrios, though cute and wonderful, is more practical. Though the Faefolk are wary of other races encroaching on their lands, they still see the value of not scaring off Anthoran and other races as allies, and therefore try to keep the entrance welcoming.   
The original path curves west and leads into the main atrium of the Central Hall of Cooriechrios (Referred to as The Coorie).  There is the crest of Drasil on the floor which is recessed leading down to the main fountain of Faenkra, which pilgrim pay tribute. Many lanterns hang from inside the chamber. A large Thimberbough spirals up inside of the Central Hall to lead to upper levels. On the eastern side of the Central Hall is Ticker of Tuuneth the gift of Boonstone the Gnome crafter to Drasil. Boonstone is one of the great holographic tinkers in Faewood and now resides in his own workshop out in the wild.

## Witheryn

Part of the Kingdom of the Wood is Witheryn, so named because  it’s blighted necrosis and dying realm. Witheryn encompasses the dead tree Torilkaew and the huge expanse of the Wraithwood

## Wraithwood (Forest of Bones)

Wraithwood is a large island to the far western edge The Kingdom of the Wood that has been overtaken by the undead and forsaken by Fecundia.  The undead forces rising there are because of the waning power of nemistri and the Therion Stag, and the pettiness of UrdDrasil

UrdDrasil, seeing the power of Fenkra and of the Therion Stag, assumed there could be even more power. At first he told himself this was for his people, but after he stewed upon this idea for many years he eventually sawed off the antlers of the Therion Stag to investigate and harness their powers further. This was a mistake, for what really happened was the blessing spell over Fecundia was lessened and the dark forces of the undead, which were waiting at the edge moved in to suck the rich life for their own power. This is UrdDrasil’s secret and he keeps it such from the rest of the woodfolk. Many of the western edges of the kingdom succumbed to the undead without notice. The woodfolk directly around Drasil were safe because of Fenkra. UrdDrasil kept this secret out of embarrassment. When his mother, nemistri, confronted him, he tricked her and bound her to be locked away in Torilkaew. The curse of Torilkaew sapped nemistri’s powers even dragging UrdDrasil’s kingdom further into decline. It is now a battle of life and death and the edge of Fecundia seem to shrink each day.   
UrdDrasil must be convinced to turn his ways in order to restore The Wood’s power to withstand the dark forces of the Druvenrog empire in the east, or Necromensus’ demon army in the south.

Parents of the KudDrasil call the Wraithwood the Forbidden Forest and tell scary tales to keep them from entering.

The Ancient Beast Groddifyth lay deep beneath Fecundia awaiting his chance to lay his revenge upon is half-sister Nemistri. He is the bastard son of Seydna and Grifth the Abomination. After his birth he was soon hidden away from the gods as his parents were ashamed of him; but in him lay great power that he did not even know. He lay far beneath Fecundia, disgraced of his being and with hatred of his sister Nemistri for her dominion over the realm.  
Then he discovered the bitterroot of **Nihlheeg,** part of her hibernating tail that he nourished himself for eons with. He grew strong and learned the magic of death.   
When it came time for Nemistri to inherit her throne to her 5 sons, Groddifyth, their uncle caused dissent among them. It was Nemistri’s plan, to bequeath the kingdom to her favored son, Urd. Groddifyth knew of this and planted an evil seed in his nephews’ mind of jealousy and treachery. He convinced them that in order to regain control of the throne, they, all four, must accept a pact of the bitter root of Nihlheeg to gain the power to overcome the life magic of their Mother. 

This is the current time of Deluvia.

###  

### Queen Maz

Queen Maz is the Queen of the fairy folk of Barrows, She is part of the Kingdom of the Wood empire and rests below ground in the large numinous mound of dirt among her people. Though small in stature, these folk burrow underground and mine glowstone which is used in the capital of Yore's Gallow.

Queen Maz is a benevolent ruler but is extremely xenophobic to visitors, especially those with the Y chromosome. In fact it is the females of her own realm which dominate and the males who perform the labor functions, serving the females.

The Barrow Lands is a glowstone mining area in a doline in the mountain, as well as known for profuse growth of the poppy on the hills on top. This is the source of the Barrow Folk's sleep magic and time magic. Time in the barrow is much slower than time outside of it and visitors often think they are staying days, when they in fact are staying years.

The Barrow Lands are also plagued by a pesky dirt wyrm named Heeg. His tunneling through the depths of dirt under The  Barrow Lands caused great tremors and problems for their mines until a truce was struck and Queen Maz now offers tribute once a year, of fresh meat in a ceremony in the Heeg's Chamber. This has made the Heeg slow and fat and sleepy and he no longer bothers the Barrow Folk, but does insist upon the sacrifice of a few of her people. She has instead entrapped travelers to her barrow, which are seekers of the poppy and put them in sleep stasis until the Heegs feeding, so she no longer needs to give up her own folk. She still feels guilty about this murderous contract and is looking for a way out.

Though the fairy folk lack might, they are crafty and pesky in numbers against their occasional enemy.  Their sleep and time magic, which is not well known outside the barrow can be powerful. When allied with the rest of the Kingdom of Wood, their organic magic together becomes quite formidable.

***Section 1: Racial Lore*** **PUBLIC**

### Demon

***Overview***  
	The Demon is a result of an Ancient Gargoyle soul, otherwise referred to as an ember, that co-inhabits the body of a host. Many are heavily misunderstood, as their name defines them as dark and dangerous creatures, but often in today’s society, demons can be found living alongside humans, elves, and many other races. Demons are not evil, as many believe them to be. Necromensus, the demon lord, does not oppose the teachings of Aethera, however he believes that power comes from knowledge, not faith.

***Characteristics & Magic***  
	Demons are identified by their host’s racial characteristics, along with a set of horns perched above their head, and a stout gargoyle like tail protruding from behind. Often they have a stone like complexion. Their physical body varies from Demon to Demon, mostly akin to their prior racial background. Demons are usually very intelligent, and have knowledge of many circles of magic, though they see knowledge as the base of magic, and not faith. Many prefer the circle of sorcery, due to its inclination to fire.  
***History***    
Long before the age of mankind, there was another, less human being. Some, in the ways of old, have come to refer to them as gargoyles, the stone monuments carved out to depict these wretched creatures. However, while they lacked in physical beauty, they made great progress in the form of magic. Graced by the goddess Aethera of the light, the gargoyles quickly became masters of fire and earth. But, the great goddess soon became fearful, that the gargoyles would begin to toy with powers that they were unaware of. So, she cast them out, into a new realm of only fire and brimstone. Their bodies burned in the depths of the unlit darkness, but their souls became an unsnuffable ember. After many ages, Aethera once more created beings to wander her world: humans. And, while she may have controlled their knowledge of the magic realm, where there is light, there must also be darkness. Calling from this darkness, a great demon’s voice was heard: Necromensus. He tempted humans with the gifts of fire and earth, that once only the gargoyles knew, but at the price of their mortal body to be shared by the souls of the nether. Aethera grows unpleased by this growing cultist following, however she cannot stop the calling for power. So, she made a deal with the demon lord Necromensus. If he wished to have followers bring back his gargoyles from the beyond, his followers were to remain underground for much of their lives, and cast away their affinity for light.   
A Demon is not born, but is rather created. Demons can be of any race, as long as they are willing to undergo the ritual of the Nether, merging one’s soul with a compatible ember of the nether. These “Embers” are the souls of the gargoyles.

***Culture & Faith***  
Most, if not all demons, live within a society that includes the traditional demon social hierarchy. A demon society, or coven as they are often referred to as, have several key components. Firstly, there is the Patriarch (or Matriarch if female), the political head of the Coven, who does not concern him/herself with the faith and worship of Necromensus. Rather, the leader focuses primarily on the needs of the society, and relations with other factions outside their own. On the other side, there is the faith based sect of the coven, who center themselves around the shrine to the Nether realm. The heads of this sect are called Necromensi, the translators of Necromensus who follow his orders, and conveys them to the Patriarch or Matriarch. Often more times than not, the Necromensi are multiple in number, and spend many hours during their day near the shrine to commune with Necromensus. The Necromensi are chosen among the population for their natural affinity with the nether realm, and their ability to hear the other side better than others. Below the political and faith heads of the coven, there are the Eminent ones, those who have a deep connection to their ember. Many are considered the most powerful among the common Demon, and many have power as generals, and advisors under the hierarchy. Finally, there are the acolytes, and the shriven. A shriven is a person who is not yet demon, but is living among their society. Either they prefer not to receive a demon soul and just wish to be close to Necromensus, or they have yet to undergo the Nether Ritual. After receiving an Ember from the ritual, the shriven becomes an Acolyte, a member of the demon society. Many demon societies are underground, as to keep them closest to their lord, as well as stay in the darkness. While they are not required to live within their own societies, and many do not, demons find it easier to be with others of their same faith, as they cannot reverse the ritual.  
Most demons worship Necromensus, the demon lord, as their god. Necromensus often disputes this claim, as he prefers to be considered just a leader of his people, and the gate-keeper between here and the nether realm, since Gargoyles are unseen. Most covens keep a nether portal open inside their society as a way to communicate directly with Necromensus, and to host rituals within their society instead of demanding a pilgrimage. 

***Naming***  
	Demons have two names: their birth name before the ritual, and their nether name. The latter is a direct merger between the name they were given at birth, and the name of the ember that now resides within them. (Gargoyle names are added after the birth name with a ‘. For example, a human named Jessup Mills, will now be Jess’Hyndra. Gargoyle names are generally more ancient in style.)

***Racial Relations***  
	Most demons are friendly to all races, as their kind does not exclude any race from becoming a demon. After a transformation, some demons even leave a coven and become members of other societies and factions.

***Subtypes***  
	Demons do not per say have specified subtypes, but rather every kind of race appears differently as a demon. The only thing in common between demons is their horns and tail.

### Ent

***Overview***  
	As opposed to common belief, Ents are in fact not sentient beings made from trees. Rather, the walking plant that is the Ent, is really a facade. The real brain is something known as a Heartroot, a parasitic plant growth, much akin to the *album* species. The Heartroot grows deep within a host form, normally humanoid from what it has seen wandering its woods. 

***Characteristics & Magic***  
	Many Ents appear as humanoid beings made out of wood, or some sturdy material with plant life growing from its center. Physically, Ents are strong, but slow, much akin to their perception of time. Mentally, Ents are usually wise beyond their years, as they have seen many a war, and have survived through all of them. However, it is important to note that an Ent does not consider themselves old until they have found their purpose and fulfilled it according to their own personal standards. Many Ents may act young, although they could be ages old, and just have not settled with their standing in the world.   
	While Ents are seen as magical beings due to their sentience, most do not show an affinity towards any specific circle of magic. Ents do seem to show favor towards the circle of clericy, due to the way they grant life to themselves and others, but Ents are not specialists in any form of magic, including clericy.

***History***  
	The origin of the Ent is unknown, as the light goddess Aethera has little knowledge of where they came from. Most speculate the first Ents grew out of the forest, as their species of non sentient *album* is found there. However, there are some Ents that appear like Cacti, and some like seaweed, giving some the speculation that perhaps there are more than one subspecies of Ent. Historically, all though it is outlawed now in many nations, Ents were hunted by Elves for their Heartroot, due to its potent healing properties. This has led to tension between the Ents and Elves for quite some time. 

***Culture & Faith***  
	Ents tend to blend into the culture of where they settle in, as they believe that they must first find their purpose. The only occupation they fear is anything associated with fire. While many Ents are not seen as faithful, and many are in fact nomadic, there is a general faith amongst Ents that praise the Earth Mother, for her life giving gift.   
	Ents see eating as something which is cultural, not persay required. Ents do not have a digestive system, so while they may consume food and chew it, they actually only need water and in most cases, sunlight, to survive.  
	  
***Naming***  
Names of Ents are usually self instituted, and can often change as an Ent goes through its life. The name is usually indicative of the career path the Ent chooses, but again, can change. The naming custom of Ents also is determinate of their age identity. Those that are still wanderers, have the ending \-Sap attached to their name. Those who have settled in their lives have \-Root ending. And finally, those who have retired from their careers and await death, have \-Branch. (An example: Ent who is determined as a farmer, would likely be named Wheat-Root. It is a simple structure.)

***Racial relationships***  
	Ents are usually friendly towards all races, however, there is a deep set fear and hatred of Elves, as the Elves were hunters of Ents in ages before. Also, Ents direct fear of fire has also led to a mostly irrational fear of even the kindest of Demons. 

***Subtypes***  
	Ents have many different forms that have been seen over time, and it is becoming common to name an Ent after the biome in which it seems most affiliated with. Ents cannot become demons.  
Forest Ent: The most basic of Ents, normally made out of wood from an old tree. Also have a tendency to bear fruit.  
Carved Ent: An Ent body that was created from stone or crystal, normally carved by other Ents to harness a Heartroot.  
Desert Ent: An Ent born from a hollow Cactus. The body was meant to survive a long time without much nutrition.  
Mush-Ent: An Ent that grew out of a mushroom, and usually dwells below ground or in heavily shaded regions.  
Sea Ent: An Ent that somehow managed to grow underwater using a mix of coral and seaweed as a body.

### Anthoran

***Overview***  
	The Anthoran are a unique race that some believe originates from the elves. They share many characteristics of animals, as in part, they are animal. All Anthoran have a coming of age ritual that they embark on to find the other half of themselves; their animal spirit. Once found, they merge with it to become one with it, and therefore be considered whole. They are spread out far and wide across the world, and are incorporated deep in the history of many nations.

***Characteristics & Magic***  
	Anthorans have two forms. Their “blank” state, and their “true” form. The blank state is a form before an Anthora has completed their journey, and can be returned to once completed when choosing to walk alongside their animal spirit. Most Anthoran look like a humanoid version of their spirit, and share the same senses their animal spirit does.  
	Anthorans do not seem to show favor towards any form of magic, but some still become mages practicing one or another circle. Like most races, it takes a long time for them to become good at magic, as they do not have a strong sense of magic either. 

***History***  
	The history of the Anthora is checkered at best. Each tribe has legends and myths as to how they came about, but most common Anthorans are spread out in small communities, or other various factions. Most have the belief that they were originally elves that experimented with a circle of nature, but it is unknown if those rumors are true. However, it seems that the traditional coming of age ritual to find one’s spirit animal seems to always be a constant among the history of the Anthoran race.

***Culture & Faith***  
	Most Anthoran culture varies from tribe to tribe, and there is no strong denomination of faith that they tend to favor. Many have specific tribal gods and goddesses, but it rarely spills outside into the more mainstream religions of the world. 

***Naming***  
	Anthoran names take after Elvish origins, suggesting a deeper ancestral tie to the elves. However, in some tribes, Anthorans will have separate names for themselves after their ceremony, leaving their original name to their animal, and naming themselves something entirely different.   
***Racial Relationships***  
	While Anthorans as a people, are considerably well versed with every race, one in particular always seems to derive some level of animosity between them. Nemedi, the mechanical runic race of beings, show a direct disregard for the Anthorans cultures, ways, and mostly everything else, considering it outdated and iconoclast.   
   
***Subtypes***  
	Anthoran subtypes are as diverse as there are animals in the world. Some choose to identify one other form of Anthoran, many refer to as Gillaquids. Gillaquids, are distinctly like Anthorans, and many believe that they are close relatives to the Anthoran race, however, they live primarily below water. Their faith and culture differs much from the Anthoran race as well.

### Gillaquids

	  
***Overview***  
	Anthorans are often the more prominent of the two races, however, Gillaquids are believed to have come from some derivative of the Anthoran bloodline. Gillaquids[^5] are a mostly aquatic race, however, they can spend some time above land before having to return below the water. Many are considered strange by the standards of surface people, thus enforcing the stereotype that Gillaquids prefer to live amongst others of their own kind.

***Characteristics and magic***  
	Gillaquids are not exactly the same as Anthorans, as they are born as they are, and do not have a blank form. Gillaquids resemble many aquatic creatures, ranging from fish, to sharks, to even squids. They often are less nomadic than Anthorans, as they prefer to stay below the water in their communities. Mentally, Gillaquids are normally considered all across the board, ranging from brutish, to gentle and intelligent, but one similarity is their sense of community with one another.   
	Magic is a topic which is all too familiar for Gillaquids, however, their grasp of it is rather limited due to their isolation. Through generations, Gillaquids are taught the basic forms of the water circle of magic, endowing them with the ability to move above water as well, and onto the land. To enhance this further, many Gillaquids have also turned to the progressive forms of technology magic to create suits used to move above water, while keeping in a body environment that is both aquatic and pressurized.

***History***  
	Most prefer to keep the Anthoran and Gillaquid history apart in the books, however, given the elves experimentations with nature circles in the past, it is unclear whether they had a part in the Gillaquid’s creation. Most Gillaquids prefer to remain away from war and the complications of it, and instead have focused almost entirely on their dedication to creation and innovation. As such their history is layered with many inventions throughout the ages, but not much else. Beyond their tendency to be stalwart inventors, not much else is vital about their history, as many say their most recent endeavours above water is truly the start of their history. 

***Culture and Faith***  
	The culture of the Gillaquid is not one of war or exploration, but rather one of invention. While many associate the Nemedi with the innovation and more progressive circles of magic, it is truly the Gillaquids who have been doing it for all of their existence. Within their first five years of life, an Gillaquid is expected to have either invented, or created something worth mention for their family’s namesake. For many ages, it was common for Gillaquids who were not creative or innovative, to be banished from their village until they had a breakthrough of some kind. This was a normal practice up until the last two generations, where Gillaquids have taken an interest in exploring above water with the environment suits designed to keep their body stable on the surface. As such, the practice to invent is slowly becoming more and more obsolete, though some believe the Gillaquids are simply exploring above water to begin a new era of invention with the surface in mind as well.  
	Gillaquids are well aware of the gods and goddesses that inhabit the realms beyond and on the surface, however, as none of them have paid much mind to the race living below the water, Gillaquids are rarely known to worship any god at all. Some do ask for blessings from the progressive gods, but often more times than not, they believe that anything can be achieved without the aid of a deity.

### Nemedi

***Overview***  
	The Nemedi are a fascinating race that continues to gain interest from those who study the ways of the ancient and long forgotten circles of magic. One in particular which has given many researchers a challenge is the circle of tech. While many Nemedi wander the world, few have succeeded in passing their names into history, as many Nemedi were treated as second class citizens up until the current age. 

***Characteristics & Magic***  
	Nemedi appear as an odd assortment of metal objects, leading to many accidentally mistaking them to simply be people in armor. However, under that massive clutter, is nearly nothing except for a singular rune like object, a crystal known to most as a lacrima, or soul gem. Nemedi have been known to change their form on occasion, but most of the time it is a simple adaptation to the gem and it’s growing life. After the lifespan of a Nemedi is completed, the soul inside is released, and awaits a new soul to power it. Often the gem lays dormant for years until it finds a wandering soul to fill it. The magic wipes the memory clean of the soul, and begins a new life, completely clueless, leading to many Nemedi struggling to find their way in life.   
	Nemedi are not normally known to wield magic, however, in a world of people that use magic in daily life, it is hard for them to avoid it completely. Often, Nemedi prefer technology over magic for many scenarios, but this has also lead to a weakening of their lacrima, the very core of their life force. Those that have used magic have noticed one or two years less of their normally one hundred year lifespan. 

***History***  
	The exact origins of the Nemedi race is almost entirely known, however, getting to that point again is nearly impossible. Nemedi were the final creation of the circle of technology, a taboo sect of the magic circles, and now is considered a forbidden magic. The reason so, is because the origins of tech magic began with a combination of psychic, and soul magic, which at the end had deadly results. To create a soul gem, something to possess the body of the Nemedi, required a human sacrifice. Many died in the process of creating these gems, but once they were perfected, many of the original circle mages, sacrificed themselves to gain a new form. They sought immortality, however, upon awaking, they had no memory of their former selves, and have since merged with many other societies for survival.  
	The Nemedi people were noted for their dark origins early on, as many knew of the tragedies that took place in order for the circle to succeed in its measures. Often viewed as the gruesome result, Nemedi were treated as second class citizens up until most recently, where many are given some opportunities afforded to the rest of the races. However, being equal and not feared as some experiment has yet to reach fruition. But, many lucky Nemedi have found themselves adopted into families, as a brother, sister, cousin, or just a friend of the family.   
In recent times, the Nemedi have twisted their magic into a dark arts of tech. They tend to blend in with a highly armored version of a reptile Anthoran with their distinctive black cloak.

***Culture & Faith***  
	Most Nemedi do not have a culture, as it is their nature to be born without a society or family. Those that do make sure to pass away with people who will welcome the new soul as almost a child of the former. Nemedi have on occasion been known to worship Necromensus, the demon lord, as often they deem him as a lord of knowledge. While they themselves cannot become a demon, and host an ember, many times they are greeted amongst demon societies with honor, as many demons also face the cruel reality that their appearances and origins can scare the commoner. 

***Naming***  
	Nemedi are often poor when it comes to naming themselves, and usually end up with the strangest of names. Many have noticed Nemedi names are directly related to the first thing they see, and can identify. However, those who don’t name themselves, and instead awake to find themselves with family around them, will often take the name granted to them. (In this case, a common name for a Nemedi could be Nail, or even Rock.) 

***Racial Relationships***  
	Nemedi do not hate any race in particular, but have deep angst against the many races that viewed them as monsters. While most hear the stories and legends of the circle of tech and their cruelties, they are only hurt when others enact that fear and hatred back to them. The only race they seem to have no fear of, and actually tend to be most often associated with, are Demons.

 ***Subtypes***  
	There is no direct subtypes of the Nemedi, but rather their materials are what diversify them. Nemedi also have a tendency to take form of whatever soul inhabits them at the given time, but that is not to say that a Nemedi who grows close to a specific race will not begin to form attributes of such race. (You can have a Nemedi that looks like an Ent, Anthoran, or even Demon).They are not genderless however, and usually identify one way or the other. 

### Formori

***Overview***  
	The Formori is a fairly new creation, as their origin was to fight for the Wars of the Third age. Some consider them the more organic alternative to the original focus of the Nemedi’s creation, however, most Formoris are hostile to many outside their own race, but they dominate the great arenas that litter the world.

***Characteristics & Magic***  
	Formoris are a physically powerful race. Their bodies are born from the earth itself, giving them a hard shell, or exoskeleton in which many use as their armor. While most cannot see under their solid rock exoskeleton, under it is believed to be a soft mass of muscle, much akin to insects whom they are most related to. The Formori race have not two, but four eyes, two in front, and two on their sides, in which was specifically formed for combat. Mentally, Formoris strive for combat, making many spectators and competitors in the arena. They are in fact not the smartest of any race, and often are regarded as the dumbest, but their battle strategy skills have far surpassed their Elvish creators.  
	After a Formori dies in battle, their new body is grown from the water. Formoris, as their original purpose was for war, their bodies mature quickly, moving from birth to adolescence to adulthood within mere weeks. In adulthood they stop aging, as it seems only death can be their end. However, after death, they are quickly reincarnated anew, from the blessed waters. But, unknown to the elves, as their water spread through the rivers, Formoris can seemingly be born from anywhere alongside a waterbed.   
	Magic is often regarded as a taboo of the Formoris, but some have been known to wield it or study it time to time. Formoris normally rely on their extremely strong bodies to fight in hand to hand, or weapon based combat, and have rarely been seen with any weapon of range. 

***History***  
	The Formori are one of the three created races, Nemedi and Demons often considered close relatives by the non created races. Formoris were created for use by the Elves during the Third Era Wars, to make up for the Elves deficiencies in combat. After the wars, Glyhics, though regarded by Elves as simply tools for a war, were indeed sentient, and were cast away from the Elvish homeland in the Kingdom of Wood for their warlike personalities that conflicted with the Elvish ways. The Banishment has created a heavy rift between the Formori and their creators, but since then, most Formori have settled down in Elvish like Tribal communities, primarily populated by the Formori. Others have moved into large cities which have arenas in which they can compete for glory and fame, or to live as a guard, always prepared to fight for justice.  
Their creation came from the ancient circle of divinity, a pure form of magic directly related to the way the gods originally created life. The elvish elders blessed the Origin Spring, a massive lake that sits in the Kingdom of Wood, and has many rivers running from it, some even into the ocean.

***Culture & Faith***  
	The culture of the Formori people is riddled with stories of war and glorious battles. It is common for a young Formori to be adventurous, as it is encouraged by their elders for all to seek their fame. While some of their culture and social structure comes from the elves, they incorporate their lust for battle as part of their society. The elders, as they are often referred to, are not exactly the oldest, but rather the most powerful. Every year, a new group of elders is selected from the trials, a series of battles between the strongest individuals in the tribe for who will be leader. The results of the trials are a direct correlation to the positions the elders have, as seniority plays no role either.   
	Formori families are somewhat similar to the Nemedi, having roots near wherever they are born. However, most tribes have taken advantage of the benefits of the water rebirth, and formed their communities near certain spawning spots. Also, because of this, a tradition is held every year that the Formori rebinds him or herself to the blessing of the water, and therefore ensuring that upon death, they will return with their memories and amongst their relatives and friends once more. It is not uncommon for children in a family to end up raising their parents until they are of age as well.  
	As death is not a subject of fear amongst the Formori, many lead reckless lives in search of their glory and honor. Formori are usually regarded as some of the most courageous of the races, and will take up nearly any job that toys with death. However, as death is a subject of direct rebirth, and their memories remain in tact over every lifetime, Formoris who hope to start anew do not renew their blessing. Without the blessing, the Formori is born without their memories, and normally far from their tribe’s water source, usually closest to where they die.   
	While originally some older Formori believe that their one true goddess is Nemistri, the creator of the Wood, many of the new generation believe that their goddess has forsaken them, just as the elves did. Instead, they have begun to worship Zweihanar the god of war who guided their hands in battle and after, it was he who lead the Formori people from the Wood. Often referred to as First Ancestor, Zweihanar is an honorary Formori, and as legends hold, his glorious feats will be passed into all of the Formori people, as long as they hold fast to the beliefs of Zweihanar: glory and honor is obtained through battle.

***Naming***  
	The names of the Formori are often one in the same with their past life, making many names consistent throughout the ages. More often than not, since the Formori are born akin to the age of five in human years, they can speak and thus name themselves. Even a Formori who has lost their memories, will often remember their name. (Formoris, if you don’t know by now, are basically orcs with 4 eyes. Thus, name it like an orc).

***Racial Relationships***  
	The Formori have a strange way of communicating, as often most others perceive as aggression, is really just how they treat everyone. Because of that, they tend not to make friends with any races in particular. On the other side, the Formori have a certain disdain for two races: Nemedi, and the elves. Nemedi is likely because the Formori are normally compared to them on a regular basis, and elves because of their checkered past after the third era wars. 

 ***Subtypes***  
	The Formori have no specific subtypes, and are in fact one of two races (the other is Nemedi), who cannot become a demon. Each Formori comes in a variety of shapes and sizes, and they identify as either male or female. 

### Endaurs

***Overview***  
	The mysterious race of beings that wander out from the end. Pilgrims from a broken world, hoping to start anew in a great world. But, is their intentions pure, or shall they bring the same destruction upon their new world, as it is believed that they brought upon in their old one.   
***Characteristics & Magic***  
	The Endaur race is a humanoid race of beings, that nearly looks identical to elves, however, their almost void black skin and purple eyes set them apart. Their physical strength is actually quite lacking, as many are considered to be weak in strength, however, what they lack, they make up for in immense knowledge. As such, many Endaurs are esteemed mages, perhaps even more so than Elves, but that is up to debate. They seem to have a stronger affinity to dark magic, thus birthing the term “Dark Elf” to classify their species.  
***History***  
	Endaurs came from beyond the void. Before their exodus from the End, as it has become commonly referred to, not much is known about the Endaurs. Endaurians distinctly don’t write down their history, and instead it is passed down through generations by their ancestors. As such, their history only depicts two great events in the other realm. One, was the birth of the dragon. It has plagued the world of the End for as long as their people have known, and travellers to the abandoned realm consider it a worthy challenge to attempt at finally slaying the beast for good. But, it is to no avail, as every time, the dragon is reborn. The other event was the great plague. Some consider it a combination of insanity, and a physical warping of the body. Whatever the plague is, it contorts the victim into strange slim and tall creatures. While they resemble the Endaurs, these Endermen, as they have been come to be called, are a threat to all who encounter them. Endermen, the afflicted of the end plague, have a drive to snatch precious resources from the world, and return them to their homeland, for what some believe is their attempt at rebuilding the broken world. The Endaurs brought the Endermen with them from the void, but quickly made note that they would take care to ensure they would not become a nuisance upon the world. While many view their promises as empty, it is vastly difficult for Endaurs to kill others whom once may have been a friend or a relative.   
***Culture & Faith***  
	Endaurs have their own system of society, often using a chamber of intellectuals to guide their ways. Many decisions made by the intellectuals affect entire communities of Endaurs and their surrounding villages as well. While they might not be entirely spiritual, it seems that Endaurs split their culture between magic, and faith. Magic, to the common dark elf, should be considered a great honor to wield, and therefore many dark elves practice it only when necessary, or when in study. But, they make sure to keep it separated from their faith.  
	The Endaur faith revolves around two gods, the twins. One, is the goddess of the past, Alpea, and the other is the god of the future, Omgion. Dark elves pray to both in different respects, the past to grant them wisdom of their history, and give them knowledge from ages long ago, and the future to guide their way and hopefully keep them safe in their travels into the unknown future.  
***Naming***  
	The Endaurs are also considered elves, as their naming system reflects rather closely to the elves’ style, but lack some fluency in the style too. Where there is often an “S”, the Endaur language uses a V instead, since there is a lack of the “S” sound. Also, the ‘Th” sound is not something within their language, so instead a “Z” replaces it. (So for a name like Serenith, it would be Vereniz instead).  
***Racial Relationships***  
	Endaurs are not a hostile race, otherwise they would have died out long ago. They are actually considered among some of the top political powers amongst the races, and many Endaurs have taken seats of power to ensure equality for their pilgrim brothers and sisters. In fact, most are rather well spoken and as such, have managed to form solid relationships with many of the races.  
 ***Subtypes***  
	There are no direct subtypes of Endaurs, but they are one of the races that can become demons, although most Endaurs would consider this a direct casting out of their faith. 

### Goblins

Goblins are not a playable race yet.  They are, however a race that is throughout Deluvia and able to be interacted with.

## *Section 2: Religious Lore* PUBLIC

**Religious Lore:**

Within the first era of Deluvia, there were those that killed the ancient dragons to ascend beyond their own souls. These beings created were created through the fallen scales of ancient dragons, but killed their creators to surpass them into legend, and the great Aetheric and Endaric realms beyond. These beings, gods as they are often referred to, now dictate the worlds workings from their new home, the land of immortality, however, some have returned to ensure their worship from the beings that still inhabit Deluvia. Though, some believe their return has harrowed the great deluge, as the angered dragons who now exist as one with the world, rupture and split the land to destroy all that the gods care for. 

Gods exist in many realms, in which have often determined who has worshiped them over the ages.  
**Aetheric:** The realm beyond, where the gods who orient themselves with faith are often from. It is considered to be an immortal realm somewhere locked out of time, but is normally pictured as a place of light and perfection.

**Endaric:** The void realm, a place of darkness and mystery, often associated with gods of knowledge and progress. As an alternative to ascencion, some gods proceeded into the end to study the unknown land. 

**Deluvic:** The realm of the surface. Dominated by the mortal races, and once by the gargoyles, gods, and dragons before them. Deluvic gods are those that have returned to their land of origin to bestow knowledge, or ensure faith, amongst the mortal races.

**Netheric:** The final realm of fire and brimstone that had existed once as perhaps the home to the ancient dragons, now used as a prison for the souls of the gargoyles. A realm dominated by one god, or lord as he is often referred to, Necromensus, and, is home to his wife, Embreas. 

***Faith Gods:*** Often regarded as the first gods, these are the most prominent of the gods who have many who know, and worship them. Their primary goddess is Aethera.

**Aetheric**\- Aethera, the goddess of light and worship. Aethera is often regarded as the mother of all the gods, and perhaps the most powerful. She was the first to ascend, and is normally associated with light and worship. She has taken a backseat to current worshiping practices, and is rarely heard from, even by those who are her most diligent priests. She is said to have dictated the roles of the other ascended, and their powers. Aethera is normally depicted as a being of light, without a physical body.

**Deluvic**\- Zweihanar, the god of war. Zweihanar is the honorary First Ancestor of the Formori people as he was their guide out of the Wood. He is often considered taboo to worship, as he takes a position on the battlefield alongside whichever side pleases him most on a whim. His powers are guaranteed victory to those whom he sides with, though he has been known to switch sides. He has appeared in many time periods, however, one thing in common is he prefers to hide his true form in a massive dark suit of armor, thorned and bloody from many battles. It is feared that one day he shall rise alone and proceed to wage war against all mortals for his own humor.

**Endaric**\- Tresola, the goddess of chaos and luck. Tresola is often one of the least common gods to worship. However, though she might not be a primary goddess with many followers, she does get a fair share of worship from those who wish for luck, and possibly for bad luck to fall upon others. She resides in the Endaric realm, though often appears in Deluvia using her shapeshifting powers to deceive others for the sake of chaos. Her true form depicted in art is usually a mixture of many creatures, thus further depicting her chaotic nature. Tresola is the sole inhabitant of a sub-Endaric realm, originally intended as a prison for her, designed by the gods in the Aetheric realm to control her chaos. However, with her deceptive skills, Tresola managed to gin control of the realm, and in turn, anchored it to the Deluvic realm for all existence. Her very presence in Deluvia is often attributed for all manners of misfortune, and great fortune alike. Recently, in order to attain a greater standing of power, she has opened her gates to the mortal world, allowing Deluvians to pass into dungeons of chaos she creates to entertain herself with. Those that succeed can be guaranteed great fortune, but those that fail can be assured death. 

***Traditional Gods:*** Gods that tend to be worshiped among the common people. Normally do not ally themselves in the battle between faith and knowledge, but still embody a large force of god-like power. Their primary god is Sifaneus.

**Aetheric**\- Finora, goddess of natural forces. Finora is the very embodiment of the natural realm and all it’s elements. She is normally regarded as the elemental goddess, however, she takes a very lite role in the circles of magic. Although Finora remains in the Aetheric realm, she is not as dominant of a primary goddess, as Sifaneus is the more notable of the traditional gods. Finora is depicted as a being of earth, water, and air, caring for the world, over it’s inhabitants. As such, she also is considered a goddess of life and death, and is prayed to by those who wish to prolong their life in times of illness. 

**Deluvic**\- Sifaneus, God of Justice and leadership. The most prominent of the Traditional gods, and perhaps one of the strongest forces of all the gods in Deluvia. He actively sits as a king among the mortals, as both judge and jury of the people. While he is normally regarded as a fair and equal king, some grow weary of the leadership of an unaging god, and in the past have challenged his regime, to their own demise. He is often depicted in his royal attire and seated on his massive throne. 

**Netheric**\- Embreas, goddess of the hearth and family. Embreas is a rare example of a rogue goddess. Her sorrowful history began when she descended during the second era, for her love of the Gargoyles. Her compassion for all living beings lead her to fall in love with Necromensus, one who pursued knowledge for the betterment of all. But, their forbidden love is often regarded as the downfall of the gargoyle race, along with his relentless pursuit of knowledge, and possibly ascension. After his kind was banished from the world, she joined him in the Netheric realm, not as a lover, but as an eternal wife. Her compassion and love are regarded as reason to worship her, as she has become the symbol of the hearth in every home. Families believe the hearth will bring her warmth into their home and hearts. 

***Progressive Gods:*** Less like gods, and more like great teachers. The progressive gods take a very active role in the wisdom and knowledge of magic, and often will make great impacts in history throughout the ages. The most prominent of the progressive gods is Necromensus, however, he is also the least powerful. 

**Netheric**\- Necromensus, the Demon lord of the Nether and seeker of knowledge. Before he was cast from the world, he was an esteemed master of many circles of magic. His prowess however, was deemed the curse of his race, the ancient gargoyles. Aethera and the other gods feared his power, and cast him to the nether, where he takes a rather active role as a purveyor of research of knowledge and magic through his demon followers. He is the gatekeeper of the Netheric realm, assisting in the transfer of embers into their hosts without fail. 

**Deluvic**\- Astorius, the god of the cosmos. Astorius was one of two gods who sided with Necromensus in his plight for knowledge. Astorius is wise beyond many, knowledgeable in the great circle of cosmic magic, and takes an active role with his followers in the citadel known as the observatory. While many of his practice have disappeared over the years, legend has it that he still sits in the decaying observatory with his remaining followers, peering into the great beyond, trying to decipher celestial runes and call upon the powers. However, there are those that believe his perception of the great beyond can be used to dominate the land.

**Endaric**\- Aplea and Omgion, the twins of past and future. The twins of the Dark Elf race only began to be worshiped within the late third era, as they represented two gods who came over from the void realm of the end. Alpea and Omgion were the first to teach the Endaurians how to travel through portals into Deluvia, however, some believe they were also responsible for assisting Necromensus in communicating through the nether portal to his first followers. They are not actively involved in the politics of the world, but instead are worshiped for their powers of vision of past and future. Alpea, goddess of the past, is a connection to ancestral spirits who have passed into the void. Omgion is the guide of the future, worship for his riddles that predict events to come. They are normally depicted as dark elves, though one with white eyes, and the other with dark eyes. 

***Other Gods:*** So, terms do not exactly fit those who’ve managed to ascend beyond mortal status, as these beings have not persay been accepted by the first and second era gods. These, “other” gods, tend to find themselves in a classification limbo, as usually, they do not fit in among the common religious practices, and nor do they have many worshipers who grant them a title of a diety worth worship. That being said, it is possible to ascend to the status of a god, though the method is normally involving a deal with an already existing god, and usually will require a matter of eternal servitude as their minor. Thus, normally only the relatively insane, or those with nothing better to do, will go after the challenges put forward by the gods in order to become one. 

**Deluvic**\- Anona, the Chronicler. Like most Deluvic gods, Anona walks among mortal kind. Unlike most Deluvic gods, Anona does not see fit to be called a god in any way or form, and thus has a tendency to hide their god-hood from others. That being said, Anona became a god through the challenge of Astorius, as they were given the task to chronicle all the happenings, in all the world, at the same time. An impossible task for a human, but Anona in turn asked to be granted a deity like power to walk among the mortals for eternity, appear in multiple places at once, and be guised as anything, or anyone in order to complete such a massive task. Wise as he was, Astorius granted the wish unknowingly, giving Anona the status of a god, who now simply wanders our world. As such, Anona can be anyone or anything, always watching, and recording. His or her (they come in many forms) words can be found in almost every history book, and even in many newspapers, often making others assume mortal authors use the name as well, to gain fame for their publishings. 

***Main quest: Forbidden Rising***

In the main quest-line, the player discovers that there is a rising power called the Forbidden Truth trying to ascend their leader to become a god, through dubious sacrifices. The main quest-giver will provide the player with a pretty straightforward goal, but with multiple possibilities. 

Beginning: The Origins of War

“In the North, there is a group growing in power. They call themselves the Forbidden Truth. Apparently they want to become gods or something. I don’t really know all the details, but hey, if you want to figure it out, go ahead.”

Decision: Divided 3 ways, go to the capital of each kingdom and find an attendant of the court to give you more information on how bad the Forbidden Truth is, and how they’re trying to stop it, so you have to join them, blah blah blah.

OR: Travel north and come across one of their sacrificial temples, and get inducted as a member by killing an NPC.

Key decision: To Kill a God

This one is a bit trickier, as it has 4 different possibilities. 3 depending on your kingdom, and 1 if you’re part of the cult. 

Decision: Once more, 3 ways depending on your kingdom. It works sort of like rock paper scissors, as each kingdom has one that they are hunting, and one that they are hunted by. For example, Faith attacks Progress, Progress attacks Tradition, and Tradition attacks Faith. I’ll flesh out the reasoning for each later, especially when we write out NPC quest dialogue. The Gods that are being hunted are the Deluvic ones listed above. Depending on Kingdom alliance, you will hunt one god for a piece of their soul to return them to their realm of origin (Endaric or Aetheric) so they can no longer exist in Deluvia. I think upon reaching the god, there will be two options available to the player. One, will be simply to fight the god a PNPC that will result in the drop of the soul shard (a renamed end crystal). The other option is to do it completely in roleplay, essentially trying to convince the god to hand over their shard as the player is considered worthy. I see this going three ways depending on the boss. Progress (God of knowledge) requires a hefty Intelligence stat, Traditional (God of Leadership) requires a strong Charisma stat, and Faith (God of War) requires a strong Strength stat. 

OR: As this is a much less desirable path by players, the difficulty and yield will be much higher. Every player in this path has to defeat not one, but all three of the gods, retrieving their shards to sacrifice to the cult leader for ascension. 

Final section: Ending Ascension / Gods Among Us

This is the final result of the questline, and a turning point for the history of the game. It is actually a large server event, held for multiple weeks during probably a month or so, and it is basically a massive PVP event. After the decisions of the prior quests, the players will be tasked to defeat or defend the cult leader during his ascension ceremony. Now, here’s where it gets interesting. The Cult Leader boss (PNPC) will be given extra armor, health, and even weapons, based on how many shards were retrieved by players allied in his quest line. The fights will take place in the weeks before his ascension, as the kingdoms are trying to weaken him before he has a chance to ascend. The battles will be between 1-8 player teams from the kingdoms, versus 1-4 player teams from the cult \+ the cult leader boss. Now, the kingdom teams also have a benefit on their side. Depending on which god was killed the most, the players from every kingdom will receive a special weapon that emphasizes that god’s powers. 

Results: Should the Kingdoms succeed and weaken the boss enough to a point where he cannot ascend, they shall be victorious, and the players will get an extra reward from their kingdom of choice, along with the rewards gained if they or their party defeat the cult leader.

OR: Should the Kingdoms fail, the Cult leader shall ascend to god status, and enter the Aetheric realm. As a reward for their compliance, he gives his followers an extra reward on top of what they gained if they or their party defeated the onslaught party. 

Lore changes: This is a big one. As this concludes chapter one of the server, we will add in the results of player decisions into the lore. 

The Kingdoms- The Kingdom that had the most success (quest completion) will be deemed the most powerful of the period, and the other two shall also be labeled in kind. 

The Gods- The god that was killed the most will now be considered bound to his prior realm. He will no longer exist in Deluvia, essentially leaving a void for the Kingdom that benefitted from that god the most.

The Cult- This one hinges entirely on the results of the event. Should the Kingdoms succeed and trump the cult leader, the cult will become less influential, and the leader will eventually begin looking into other methods to ascend, leading to the decline of the cult following through the years. The more interesting scenario is if the cult succeeds and he ascends. If he manages to ascend, he will take his place as the new god of the occult, embodying all that is involved with sacrifice and blood magic. He is considered the god of contracts, and will become perhaps something for a later quest-line.

**Section Six: Covenants**

The Macabre vineyards. 

A company widely known around Deluvia for their wines and spirits. However, deep beneath their professional exterior, lies a secret society dedicated to the company and their secrets. The Vineyard's leaves, as they are known, are assassins, known to attack seemingly at random, simply to kill those who have been tagged by the company for reasons unknown to the public. Rumors say that they chose their victims according to their blood type, or rarity, as radicals believe the Vineyard mixes the blood in to make it taste even rarer, or even darker, as a sort of ritual for the goddess Tresola, to bring fortune to their family and company. You clearly have your reasons for being a Leaf of the Vinyard, 

May your chalice always be full.

The Iron Chapel.

Becoming a member of the Iron Chapel requires great experience and even greater valor. There are two ways members have been known to join. One, is finding the first chapel, an ancient arena once used to house the Chapel's battles, now a well sought after secret. Finding it permits an initiation by combat, and winning grants membership to the Chapel. The second, is through notoriety, be it through heroism, or injustice, should one be a force to be feared, they can be brought in for the same trial should the challenge be accepted. Once accepted, members of the Chapel, otherwise known as Combatants, are pitted against one another in combat. The winner continues in the favor of the covenant, and in the favor of Zweihanar the God of war, while the loser will be lowered in their ranks. 

Your battles will bring you glory, and failures shall be met with new insights\!

Finora's Morticians

Life and death are a sacred order. The goddess of nature ensures this as best she can, but her sacred oath must be enforced. So, there are those who dig the graves, the graves of ones who wish to bring death prematurely to others. These are her Morticians, the grave diggers and keepers of Finora's order. They are staunchly opposed to the Vinyard, the ones who seek out death in order to please their goddess of luck. All they see is chaos and misfortune, so, to save this world, it is their duty to preserve life, by ending the lives of those who disrupt it. 

Your goddess calls, and the graves must be dug.

The Third King's Bards

Ages prior, there was a king who needed to redeem the legacy of his reign. As such, he sought out the bards from around the world, those who would follow both heroes, and villains alike, and revel the tales of their exploits. He summoned them to his chamber to reveal to him these stories. Many believe this are the first chroniclers, the followers of the God Anona, the wanderer. However, long past his death, the bards continued into legend, their order still following and aiding, and returning to the grave of the old king to tell him these legends, and receive in turn his gifts. 

Rally on and seek legends of glory\!

Shades of the Crypt

The shadows have always been feared throughout history, until the age of light whence it banished darkness for some time. As fire grows, and houses stay lit, the shadows must creep in the underground, and in the streets. But, there are those who seek this darkness, pining after the one truth they believe lies in the unknown. The banished God Crypto, lord of Shadows, his life in the deep Endaric realm, and his knowledge of the Netharic. A taboo Union of darkness and void, and yet, seek it they do, to become his servants. The Shades are those who hide themselves in the darkness, and flee from the light, as their power and knowledge only grows whence light is no more. 

Go now, expand the shadows to honor your God.

God Crypto: Origin-Endaric. Crypto was once a minor God hidden away in the realms of the Endaric, often forgotten. His knowledge has spanned millenniums in the Deluvic realm, yet only so much can be learnt from observing mortals in their realm. He left, though, for many who leave it is to Deluvia to study closer, or for worship. But, he dove deeper, to the realm of fire and brimstone. Few know what he was seeking, or if he found it, but now he resides in his sub-realm, tucked away from sight. The Crypt of Shadows, a dark and forbidden place. A burial ground for those who wish to serve him in this life and the next as his ever expanding shadow. A library of forbidden knowledge of the End and Nether, yet to see it with eyes that are still pure, would be to have one's soul reduced to nothing more than a shadow of their former self. And yet, those that seek it, can pursue this knowledge. Their faith to him is boundless, and in return he grants them the concord of shadows, a pact to use his powers to shroud themselves. He is often not known to other gods, but in Deluvia, he and his Shades are a legend of fear often told to children at night. But, where there is legend, there is often truth behind it.

Function of covenants. Covenants are server owned non player factions that can be joined by finding them or by completing certain prerequisites. They are optional and do not hamper or assist the player in the progression of major quest lines.

Plugin: the plugin for covenants will be rather extensive, requiring Minecraft to read certain items and add extra functions to the player when equipped in a special inventory slot.

Covenant item functions: the function of the covenant items is to provide the player with access to new options that were not allowed before. These items cannot be lost, and if they are accidentally discarded, they can be obtained through a /kit command that is unlocked when the player first joins the covenant.

# **Dungeons of Deluvia**

Note to staff:  
Quests and dungeons should always contain 

1. combat component  
2. narrative component  
3. puzzle component  
4. reward component. 

   Each room of a dungeon, for example, can reinforce and contribute to these 4 components.

   

   Dungeons are a type of quest and playable area, that and again is just a useful word to describe an area to be solved. The word dungeon, in-game, should be used as a jail in a castle.

   

   Dungeons are solvable puzzles, usually with a boss or mini-boss that a group of players, or a player by themselves, can traverse to find an end result and get  treasure and skills. They are places that have secret passages, kill unique skilled NPCs, and retrieve rare artifacts. Dungeons may be be permeable and in context with other non-dungeon areas, such as the sewer below New Pallamost but they may also follow the rules of seamless everworld, where they are whole new playable areas. 

   Dungeons can also be assigned a Level in our documentation (but not in game), to describe the difficulty and the loot table to be assigned with it. 

   Dungeons may be a step in a larger quest, or be stand-alone. They may be themed as part of a quest, or themed with some other metanarrative. 

The 12 Cursed Palaces  of Deluvia  
Though there are many questable adventure areas in Deluvia, these are the 12 major/large themed dungeons.  
At the time the 12 Sages were sprung out of the Omphalos, the darker forces of Deluvia created 12 majora demonus of the 12 Demon clans.

## The Stone Temple of Tantalon Remis Mines

*Tanta*, in the old Deluvic means Despise and *Remis* means, the first or initial, and this temple was dedicated to the demise and despisement of the mortal race. It is located in the Riftlands (-20, 256, 2847\) among the rifts and was the god’s, that hated the mortals, answer to the Omphalos. Where the Omphalos is where the mortals sprung up, this pit is where the mortals are dragged down.

Early on Hythlodaeus,, the god of fire and chaos, kennelled his mega beast, **Zalrumurlith the abominate** in this pit. Zalrumurlith would wait on the bottom of this pit that resembled a mine to entice the mortals down into it with desire for rare ores.

### Zalrumurlith The Abominate and The Pit Keepers

	Zalrumith is a beast born of the flame of Hythloadaeus, and the metals of earth were split into many by the effects of his birth. Him being made of solely fire and metal made him melt and reform into several of himself. All of the same soul but different amounts of material. They all are connected, once one feels another perish they receive a signal and begin to challenge the one who has defeated him to fight the next. He detests those who don’t accept his challenge. For they are the foolish who challenged him in his weaker forms.  
	Zalrumith is made of several types of elements, each being stronger the deeper travel happens. For they wish to go down to the core of the elements. The core of the world. But for his weaker counterparts to get that far they need more metal. Therefore he resides in the pit. Collecting ores and killing those who he will take elements from.  
	Once he grows strong enough and combines all himself to one, it’s said he will leave the cavern and challenge all those who are not metal or flame. For he despises them. For they are the ones who casted him into the pit were not made of such material of his own. 

The players begin at the top of the mine pit  in the Riftlands. They have to make their down the slopes. They may meet some stone elementals and stone phantoms swooping at them on their way down. Once they reach the bottom, they jump into their descent.

Layers  
	Each layer has its own set of ores and items. As well as mobs\!   
Layer 1  
Layer 1 will have several monsters made of stone and little reward. As they go down layers they will receive messages about the heat level increasing. Giving mining fatigue, slowness, and eventually blindness.  
	The first gate will be accessible to all. The boss Zalrumith must be defeated in his first form in order to be challenged by its next on the second layer back in the pit. Which the players must backtrack to.   
Layer 2  
	The second layer will have several fire monsters which will cause fire damage and have little defence from players attacks. They will drop blacksmithing tomes and lava crystals. Once more Zalrumith must be slain to receieve the challenge from the next level.

Synonyms to *Despise* for use in items and other theme: execrate, detest, hatred, disdain, disfavor, deplore, discountenance, loathe

## Jutrollag Basilica

Jutrollag Basilica was once the Palace Chor Bematic Riftenbleak by the Old Gods. Shortened to Riftenbleak. Charltrolate the devourer was an ancient and deep beast living in the caverns beneath Riftenbleak. When the goddess Expitik fled the core lands and arrived out here Charltrolate thought she would be a tasty treat, for he enjoyed devouring demigods like this. But for some reason he had sympathy for Expitik and her turmoils in the core lands, as the ancient beasts and titans had no love lost for the Central Kingdoms. Charltrolate and Expitik struck a deal that he take his upcoming dormancy period to lay low under the basilica while the Jutrollag people came. Expitik agreed to keep the mortals power limited and the town a small one. Charltrolate, as powerful as he was, knew that mortals would eventually, in a century or so, overcome the beasts of the deep so he tried to play his cards right. He outlived the gods, and he so shall outlive the mortals.. This name stuck because he also is able to devour souls through his minions called devourers, for which he saps some of their soul for energy and gains insight into their fears.

When Expitik left Riftenbleak go, Charltrolate came out of his dormancy very hungry. His many minions overran the old Jutrollag Basilica and returned the Riftenbleak Palace in the ruins.

Now known to the mortals as “Cowardice” because this space is intended to reduce warriors to cowards, one of Charltrolate pet goals. Charltrolate has a special grudge against the god Zweihanar, the god of war, because he feels the gods and mortals valor is an artiface that could crumble under the titans and beasts of old. Though Charltrolate knows he is not powerful enough to eat Zweihanar yet, he is biding his time to take feast on each god all the way to the most powerful. Each adventurer that comes into his lair is merely practice.

Kalimvane was the first settlement of the Jutrollag pilgrims who set up the big basilica in honor of their god **Expitik**. Expitik has long gone from the basilica and all that are left are monsters. 

BACKSTORY: Expitik is a good goddess and was outcast from Druvenrog when they turned their backs on gods and magic long ago.   
The **Jutrollag Union Brotherhood** was an old and respected guild at Druvenrog. **Terriss** was the lead cleric and **Uftan** was his cupholder. This was at a time when there were many guilds on Druvenrog and many had their own religions.   
Druvenrog started to dive deeper into technology after the Wars of the Third Age. Any type of arcane thinking was shunned and Expitik was the first to go, as she was most nature-based diety on the islands. Once her holy tree was cut down she fled and her followers were massacred by a techno-cult mob. Expitik and the escaping Jutrollags came to Kalimvane and founded and built the basilica in her honor for delivering them through the deluge and Dreadstorms.   
Terris was their loyal leader and powerful in Expitik miracola (miracles). Uftan was his protoge but wanted the miracola faster than Terris would allow. Becoming impatient, Uftan went back to Druvenrog, which in the short 11 years, had become a crawling techo-conurbanation, seeking forgiveness and acceptance. He met secretly with House Grimstok which he made a bargain to become a lackey in the House if he gave up his religion and miracola. He did, for 2 years but longed for Kalimvane, the Jutrollag’s and Expitik. He voyaged back to Kalimvane and stole the automaton **Thegot** from the Grimstok factory. When he reached Kalimvane, Terris was dead, murdered by the native barbarians of **Kwinst**. Uftan was so overcome with pain that he and Thegot, who he had to reprogram, went on a revenge murder spree of the Kwinst. For this Expitik had no pity and banished Uftan from the basilica. Some of the Jutrollags followed Uftan to build the town at the current location it is now. Expitik left the basilica with the rest of the followers to an unknown location. (They left to found the cult of the Storm Kings) She cursed the basilica and the area to be overrun with monsters. Uftan and the rest of the citizens built walls and a moat around the city to help keep the monsters at bay.   
Now Uftan prefers this history to be hidden and never spoken of. Only the original members of the Jutrollags, which there are 3 others, know the story. Everyone else in Kalimvane are newcomers. He has made Kalimvane into the trading center of that region of the Eastern Rim though, because of the monsters, commerce is suffering.   
He wants to make sure that House Grimstok can’t find him. He has a lot of worries on his mind.

The other three members from the Jutrollags are **Vanfang**, who went off to found the thieves guild; **Bildagar**, who is now a hermit in the Boarsback; and **Gregari**, a merchant in the town. By finding and talking to all three of these, and completing the Jutrollag Basilica dungeon, will open up the quest to discover this mystery.

For now, all the player knows is this is a simple trading town. And all they know is that the basilica is a monster haven.

The dungeon adventure:  
Outside the gate is one merchant, **Bleefol**  that sells potions and food. One potion he sells, a life potion, the players should buy many of, which is the best way to do damage to undead **Kawrgam** beast.

The only perceivable entrance is through the bridge as all other angles are guarded by powerful guards called Devourers. Devourer have very high physical combat. They keep a memory of the soul of everyone they kill and add it to their collective knowledge. This information they provide to Charltrolate in his quest for knowledge and search for weaknesses among mortals and gods. Everytime a player is killed by an devourer on the surface, Charltrolate gets more powerful. It is best if the players find this out and avoid all other angles except the broken bridge.

Once

The main cupola is a weathervane to harness the storms. There are four towers that must be switched to send a volt down to Charltrolate[^6] which disconnects him from his devourer fiends.  
This not only weakens him, but also weakens the devourers, and resets the information he knows about the players. In reality he knows your class, and uses spells against certain classes, first taking out clerics, then mages, etc. When the weather vane is invoked, he cannot do this power. For this reason, a minimum of four players must be in the party.

Each tower individually also unlocks a different section of the dungeon to gain access to a special storm item. One tower, that is partially destroyed is particularly hard to get to and might require a rogue to scale.

# **How Ores work**

	Ores in v1 will work as an extra benefit to mining coal ore. Mining a coal ore will have a chance for either a jewelry gem or an ore used for smithing. Crafting starts by combining 2 logs of any kind. Then following the steps of gathering clay, rocks from dirt, twine from grass and sticks from leaves. Then proceeding to make a Kiln to seared bricks to a smeltery for tools.   
	Once this level of crafting is achieved it’s to be assumed a player can learn new ones from their stations without assistance.

# **Item Mechanics**

# 	Items are defined as something that takes up a slot. A slot being a hand, armor, amulet, ring, artifact, bracelet or soulseed. An item can be upgraded according to its type. A hand item is the only exception being able to be upgraded based on what it is. A soulseed can be upgraded infinitely. A ring can be upgraded 5 times. An artifact can be upgraded 3 times. A bracelet can be upgraded 10 times.

	An item can also be enhanced with custom enchants(Subject to change to runes) if it’s a hand or armor item. A custom enchant can be made by a mage using many mana gems and special inks. These enchants can also be bought at high tiers in the stores. An item can be equipped with as many enchants the mage has levels/10.  
**Magic Mechanics**  
	Magic works with crafting skills. A player needs to research magic and increase their proficiency with the element in order to learn the spell. So a Shadow skill needs level 5 or higher proficiency levels. The levels are gained through killing a shadow boss and learning its tome of knowledge. Once the skill is achieved it can be cast without issue. A spellcaster can learn the spell if another spell caster gives it to them. So a fire mage can learn shadow magic if a trade is accepted.  
	This also makes communities of various spell casters useful. That way they can all learn each other's magic so long as their classes align. Therefore is a specified mage attempts to learn a spell from another school they cannot due to being specified a certain way already.  
**World Events**  
	World Events are large scale events that have their own part in the story. Whether it be the discovery of a dungeon for the first time or a boss leaving the dungeon it can drop amazing rewards and event world rewards such as boosters.  
**World Dungeons**  
	World dungeons contain massive amounts of content and bosses. They have amounts of floors equal to the player average level that would be entering. Every 10 floors the players will have a ‘rest area’ where they can build towns and outposts and deal in trades with other players.

# **How Magic works**

Magic is treated as energy ley lines that run through Deluvia. Magic was once used heavily in the Second Age, but had lost usage now that the technology has become prevalent. But after The Cataclysm, the ley lines seem to be stronger than ever encouraging a new generation of mages, and allowing the superstitious and those wary of technology to embrace a more meaningful way of life.

Magery is under seige from the Central Kingdoms, which now effectively comprises of Druvvenrog, which was  instrumental in winning the war against the gods. They also hate all magic and have made it a mission to destroy persecute, or imprison all mages. For now this is limited to their capital and colonies, but the threat that they expand, colonize new territories or feel it is their right to extinguish mages in all of Deluvia is looming.

Magery is still much alive in the outer rim/outlands, which consists of all of Song Tide and the Kingdom of the Wood, and those in The Long Sea that choose to.

New Pallamost, which is now a lap dog to Druvenrog purports neutrality in the magery debate, but everyone knows they still will report mages to their overseers, The Corporation Dominion (Druvenrog). For now New Pallamost is lucky enough to be allowed to worship their old gods.

Magery is controlled by the Denizen plugin.

Spells and skills are very similar as far as game mechanics goes. The main difference is that spells use **mana**.  
The other distinction is bard spells. They are called **spell songs**, and are enacted as a song but still drain mana.  
Another distinction are cleric spells, which are **prayer spells**. They are almost exactly the same as spells, but often, instead of inflicting damage, they affect a party, or an area of effect, or are involved with the miracles of their patron deity. A cleric/priest/paladin/druid’s mana is called **faith** but it is the same mechanic.  
The more important main difference is how they are in lore. Magic is mysterious and evokes supernatural abilities; same with spell songs; but skills are things that people learn with practice in the normal world. These skills, however, are feats that are above what a normal person can learn in the world and can sometimes be heroic. 

When a player chooses the Mage class, it opens up a path to learn a myriad of spells.  
NPCs will know a player is a mage class and offer them the chance to learn spells from them if they don’t know it already. Generally, less powerful spells are found in beginning areas, close to where the player starts, but that does not preclude from learning a very advanced spells. The main thing preventing them from learning an advanced skills, is if that advanced skill has a **prerequisite**. Prerequisites follow a natural path of advancement. Another thing that might prevent them from using a spell is that their mana is not high enough.  
Some spells that have a prerequisite will need the prerequisite to be at a certain level before they can learn it.

Once a spell is learned, it will show up in a player’s spell book. They can then cast it.  
The chance of the spell successfully being cast is based on the player’s **magery** skill. Every player has a magery skill, and it goes up naturally from casting spells.

**Mana** is the amount of magical energy it takes from the mage to cast the spell. It is a direct amount based on the player’s intelligence which the player can raise through spending **attribute points**. Mana can be increased above intelligence usually with equipment bonuses, or buffs.  
The **mana regeneration** rate is based on passive **meditation**, which is another skill that ever player has, and is raised through use. Use is defined as when mana is re-gained after it being spent from casting a spell. Active meditation is when a player chooses to activate their meditation skill, but they cannot do anything during that time and must remain still and concentrate. Active  meditation is much faster at gaining mana than passive meditation.

Spells  are affected by a **build up**, which is a time that is from when a player casts the spell until it actually is cast. Spells can have a **distance** limit. Spells have a recovery time, called a **cooldown**, until that, or any other spell can be cast again. Many spells have a **damage** that they inflict if they are successful. All of these spell mechanics/stats can be raised with equipment or other buffs.  
Many of these factors can be raised when the spell is leveled up. A player can level up a skill by using **skill points**. Skill points are found throughout the gain through exploration, from completing quests, etc.   
Spells are often in the category of one of the **12 elements**. For example, a fire ball is in the fire elemental magic. Some skills are percentage of 2 or more elements depending on what lore they have.   
The player that a spell is cast against has **magical elemental resistances** which have a chance to reduce the damage done by the spell.

The Mage class gets their skills from talking to NPCs and learning them or finding spells in quests, or other various ways of introducing them to that spell. 

If a player specializes in a certain elemental magic, they get a bonus. They can specialize in one by making it over 50% of the spells they have learned and/or leveled up in as that elemental. For example, if they have over 50% of their spells in fire, they get **Fire Aspect** and then get a bonus of 5% for all fire elemental spells. A spell that is considered a fire elemental spell is one that has over 70% of its damage as fire damage.   
The more the player has leveled up in a spell counts toward this calculation as well. For example, a fire ball that is leveled to 5, counts 5 times as much towards this calculation as another fire spell that is leveled at 1\.

This is explained in the Magery tab of the mechanics spreadsheet.  
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P955ScPAHCnSaXpYfGhXnIQFvqa\_WQ\_Aa3FkBUyKdSM/edit\#gid=195549530

If not given any further clarification, a mage is known as an Elementalist, and most of their spells are to cause damage in some way to a being.

# **Player Towns**

In this section we will define what it is for players to have their own town. As of version 1.0, this is a big feature of our game and should be rich and rewarding.

We use the custom (coded in Denizen) **Stronghold** plugin to manage most of the town building and protections.

## NPC combat

One mechanic of SteamFront will be RTS (real time strategy) battle and city-building components. We utilize Towny for city management, but players will be able to buy pre-made structures from NPCs with in-game money that will make their town stronger.

Players will be able to buy towers, houses, armories, that will add to defense and attack abilities of their towns and units.  Some are decorative, some are functional.  
Each can be upgraded for better results. Some have requirements.

All structures require the player to have the **Builder** Profession Class. (it does not need to be the mayor)

We will have to make sure that this mechanic is not too Overpowered, hence the class limitation above. That is, we want to make sure a player cannot wipe out another player easily. One option is to have town leaders Opt in to raiding warfare. Another is to have a grace period, or everything at Town level (20 residents) and below is unable to participate in raiding warfare. Or a combination of these.

10. Stables \- allows for calvary to be trained. Requires lumbermill, blacksmith.

#### Structure Mechanics:

The player that wants to build these special structures, must first have the **Builder** Profession.  
They can get this from training under any NPC builder, usually from a big server town. They pay the NPC some money (e.g. 320 coin) and then are then the Builder class and can start learning that group of skills. Note, they do not need any skills yet to build. Just the Class. The skills that they can level up in just, give bonuses to and more options to builds.

They can then find plans to buy from NPCs across Deluvia for the above structures. They cost as much as the materials would plus the know-how of the designer. Something around 500,000 coin is reasonable for a tower. The player then gets access to the “tower01” command, or whichever structure they bought.  
The player goes back to their town and to the location they want to build. The command has instructions and size dimensions. They command /tower01 and a glass tower in the shape of the tower gets put in the location of the player for positioning. They can then command /tower01confirm, /tower01rotate or /tower01cancel. The former then puts the schematic in the same place the glass example was; /tower01rotate rotates it 90 degrees (they can do this 3 times; and /tower01cancel of course undoes and lets them start over. Once they do /tower01confirm, the permission is taken away. Worldguard is also part of the script to make a region around the tower against grief and the owner of the region the player that placed it.  
There are then worldscript flags that monitor that region for calculations for this whole mechanic.   
For example, if another player tries to break a block on this tower, certain things can happen. There are algorithms for stats based on other factors that determine the tower’s strength. 

#### Structure Repair

There is a skill under the Builder Class that is **building inspection** and **building repair**. Building inspection will tell the builder what level of repair the structure is in. Building repair will repair the structure. That mechanic works like this:

* Level 1: The building is just placed and impervious to attack. It has WG protection for 1 week.  
* Level 2: (Week 2)The building’s blocks are able to be destroyed after 1000 (\* modifiers) hits with WG protection randomly phasing in and out. It is sometimes invincible (1/3rd chance)  
* Level 3: (Week 3\) The building’s blocks are able to be destroyed after 1000 (\*  modifiers) hits  
* Level 4: (Week 4\) The building’s blocks are able to be destroyed after 120 hits (\*  modifiers)  
* Level 5: (Week 5\) The building’s blocks lose all protection and are just normal  
* Level 6: (Week 6\) The building’s blocks randomly turn to gravel, a few per day

If the player that is the keeper of the building/that built it uses their building repair skill, It costs (1100 \* repair-Level \* tower-size)  coin to move  it up one level.  (e.g. 6600 coin from Level 6 to Level 5\)

The enemy player’s attack skills are modifiers that can add into the structures demise. For example, there is a high-level siege attack skill that can move structures down a repair level.

## Troop Notes

Troops are better controlled if the general (player commanding the troops) has the **General/Leader** Profession Class and upgrades skills such as **tactics**.

Note: Players can always hire mercenaries instead of training their own troops, but they are expensive. A mercenary is a specific, unique NPC that can be hired to help and rally troops, or just fight on their own.  
NPC soldiers are usually never as good as an average siege player or PvPer.  
Many skills under the *General* class add to the NPC soldiers abilities

Troops consume the town coffers. 10 coin per level, per troop, per day. (e.g. a Paladin will consume 80 coin per day; a full unit will consume 80 \* 16 \= 1280 coin) (1 unit \= 16 troops)  
If the money is not there, the troops disband and are lost to the player and the player must start over to train them up.

#### Controlling Troops

Troops are controlled by a player that has a **General/Leader** profession. If they are not controlled, troops are auto AI, which is then only for defense. They will attack anyone that is not a member of the town or an ally of the town when the town is under attack. They will only be able to stay in their town and not siege another town.

A General can lead 1 troop per the player’s General level to a max of 16 per unit type. (8 \* 16 \= 128 max per general if the player has their General Class leveled to 128). The General’s troops will defend the General and attack however the General attacks. The squads will automatically be broken into their unit type (e.g. swordsmen, archers), and that will be the command the general uses  
Commands:

* /archers attack \- attacks the block the general clicks on next. If other NPCs/Players/Mobs are in the way, they will attack them first.  
* /archers stop \- unit stops their attacks and will do nothing.  
* /archers defend \- unit will only defend general and themselves.  
* /archers retreat \- units will turn in the opposite direction they are facing and run for  30 \- **confidence** skill seconds and then get tped back to their spawn point in the base.  
* /archers mopup \- units will attack anything but friendlies  
*   
* /allunits attack \- the same commands can be used for all units to send all of them to do the same thing. Potentially sending 128 troops to all do the same thing.


Different General skills can add to their troops skills. (e.g. attack distance, speed), as well as skills to counter other enemy Generals and enemy troops

## Trade Ports

If a town reaches Demiburghal  level (30 residents), they will get a free trade port route with any of the server cities. They must buy a ship from a NPC boatyard for in-game money.  
Each level thereafter gets another route. At Nation level they can have a route to anywhere on the map. Each Nation level gets one more route to anywhere they choose. For each ship, the player (mayor) can choose how much to charge for passage to customers and make money for the town. This port/wharf comes with the same structure repair as outlined above.

# The Player Path

### Option 1 (Meruk Dialog):

The player starts out in Meruk’s cave  
Meruk: Ah so you’ve arrived.   
Deluvia, our world has been springing up new beings and some of them arrive here to me.  
What shall I call you? Hero, Mortal? Traveler?  
This is a harsh world, and it seems to have gotten harsher in recent times and it is no wonder that Deluvia has conjured you here to  this spot in the world, the cave in which I hide, watching Rothigport, that town down the path; and I wait for a sign.  
Are you this sign?  
All twelve of us original elder sages are recluse, yet, some of us remain close enough to the  Ecuneme to chronicle what storms are to come upon the beings of Deluvia.  
We hope that you can help us but whatever path you choose is up to you.  
We’re glad you’re here.  
Oh how rude of me, let me not get ahead of myself.  
I am Meruk, the sage of scholars and Keeper of the Deluvic Bardsong, an ancient tome chronicling our land.  
What is a scholar doing living in a cave you ask?  
Ha ha ha. Fair enough.  
All of us sages, have used our specialities to their height at one point or another during this Age of Kings, but things are not always safe for us after the Great War between the gods and the mortals, and we found new occupations in dank locations; but I do still, however, keep my books.  
I have written extensively about Rothigport and Songtide lately. Songtide being this realm, far away from the powerful civilizations, and Rothigport being one of its main commercial centers.  
I brought my family here after living in Druvvenrog as one of their top scholars. The Druvs and Venrogs are mortals too, but things have gotten hostile there for those of us seeking truth and understanding of the Great Severing. I still sneak back into Druvvenrog, to visit their libraries and to watch a skiffrunner race once and awhile, but as time goes on, this dark hole in a rock is all I have left.

1. Tell me more about how you came to Songtide.

   Me and my son met the fishermen with a few boats and a few docks in the middle of the harbor. They did this to keep away from the land barbarians that were afraid of water. We helped build the town, all out of wood, as it was the most humble of materials for a humble race of Anthorans, of which I am one. Modrik, my son, built the causeway that connected the town to the land and more pilgrims came. The Blackthorn Brothers, Merkti Prigtoon and other industrialists who cared not for magic, but for their own profits. The town grew fast.

   

   Now the young folk of town are again being attracted to magic. But this time it is different; it is a much darker form which they find alluring. The elders think it is just a fad, but pay attention and let me know what comes from it.

   

   Yes I dabble in magic as well. See. \[Meruk casts a fire touch spell\]

   I am by no means as powerful as the Four Arch Mages which watch over Song Tide and keep a veil of protection warding off evil. In fact building is even protected by their spells and pioneers must travel out among The Long Sea to find their own area to build the next stronghold or empire.

   Seek out my fellow Deluvians in Rothigport and in the islands outside of it and they can offer you help. Also be wary of certain ones of them, as more nefarious being come and lurk to steal and harm.

2. Why did you leave Druvvenrog?

   Druvvenrog was getting too dangerous for believers in the Old Gods, and for those of us from the Ancient Ways. It is a great place to make a fortune as your back is getting stabbed.

3. Who are the 12 Sages?

   We are the first mortals to crawl out of the gapping Omphalos, created by Deluvia herself we spread in the 12 directions progenerating the 12 races. If you are curious about this land, I have no doubt you will get to meet them all eventually.

4. What is this Savior you are awaiting?

   The devout from this region and what good gods are left have pled for Deluvia to suppress the Severing she has unleashed, including floods, wars, plagues and threats from within our own species. We hope that a new set of Leaders can help this land in whichever direction they see fit, as our time here is nearing an end.

I have bent your ear enough and I will see you again soon, I am sure.  
I can teleport you down to Rothigport or another nearby port to start your adventure.

1. First can you teach me that fancy fire touch spell?

   Yes, indeed, spells can be useful. Talk to more mages out there in the world to learn more.

Would you like to to to Rothigport, just out in the harbor here, or

1. Krakencay, a pirate town just out on the edge of the Songtide  
2. Kalimvane, a large island town that is far enough away to still be anonymous  
3. Gweftshire, a town in a ealm steeped in ancient magic of the faeriefolk  
4. Runesbrook, a small town in the west of Songtide

### Option 2 (Albus Dialog):

Albus: Hail and well met stranger\!  
What be thy tide?  
Heading to Rothigport?  
Oh me? I am just a wanderer who has lived out in these parts for quite awhile.  
But I needed to start a new life too as it seems the dangers spread and there is not many places a quiet existence can be lived.

Sit and stay warm by my fire as I tell you more.

Ah you are new? Let me give you some tips for your journey ahead.  
\[ *show cutscene of rothigport*\]

North, down this path will bring you to Rothigport, which has grown fast in my time living in the midst of it.

A quaint town of humble origins, but be wary of some of the new industrialists in town, willing to take advantage of newcomers. And unsavory smugglers and robbers are starting to find refuge there as well.

If you can get to the inner harbor talk to Lathander, as he is always excited to meet new folk.  
Next to him is the bank where you can safely store your goods, and docked just there is a ship of Ori Moonsails, who can take you to the Outlands to blaze your own trail in the new lands.   
Be careful out there though as those lands are a bit wild, but once you can secure your own little town, you will find safety and solace there at least.

I’m glad you’re here mysterious hero. We certainly need one in these times. Whether it be a masterful blacksmith, or a blade-wielding legend, or just a simple farmer, the more beings we can have to keep our race from becoming extinguished from those that wish to have it undone, the better.

Go, and meet your fellow travelers in Rothigport, and do come back and visit and tell me of your exploits\!

Oh you want me to teach you something? I think I have time for that. This stew is not going to be finished for a few moonticks.

Hmmm, let me ponder. . .  
Oh\! I shall show you my favorite, a blocking defense. Quite useful when running into the wrong creature out here.

There now you know something of this. Just time out your swings to stop an attack, or I hear, if practiced enough in the art, can send the missile back at the sender\! How about that. Go and try

\[*to view your learned skills, /skills*\] 

Albus: I bid thee farewell and the smile of the gods.

\[*teleports to Rothigport*\]

### Option 3 (Meruk Dialog) (Race character generation)

Ah, another lonesome spirit. How precious is life?  
I suppose you require a physical form to properly communicate, now don't you?  
I suppose it's not a difficult task for me to grant another spirit a form.  
Tell me young one. What is your preference?  
Oh yes, you can't speak. I can read your thoughts now. So tell me  
	Elf  
	Orc  
	Dwarf  
	Human

Quite the option you have chosen. Give me a moment and we will get you sorted.  
The man's voice gets harder to hear…

*(if elf)*  
Why must the spirits choose elves... I might as well make them an Orc for that\! I suppose they just want to live longer…

*(if orcs)*  
Why must the spirits choose Orcs of all things... I might as well make them an Elf for that\!

*(If dwarf)*  
Why must the spirits choose Dwarves... I might as well make them an Human for that\!

*(if human)*  
My, finally a Human has appeared... Something simple.

*(if human)*  
Open your eyes.  
That wasn't so hard now was it?

*(any other race)*  
Open your eyes.  
Great\! Now I get to scorn the one who decided to ask for such a difficult race\!

*(Player asks)* Where am I?  
I found you here in the mountains near Bardtown, the center of Songtide\!

Bardtown is probably where you should go. I hear many stories of how accepting and cheerful they are. Hopefully you don't die and become a spirit again there.

(Player asks) Who am I?  
Who? I don't know. I found you here as a spirit in my cave.

(Player asks)) What am I?  
You cannot tell me you just had me give you such a marvelous form only for you to not know what it is\!

(Player, if not human,  asks) What do you mean scorn?  
You don't quite seem to understand the task you asked me of. I had to sit here for days creating the form of *(whichever race the player picked)*

I suppose it’s water under the bridge now.

Do you have any other questions before you let me back into my isolation?  
*(player says)* I will leave now.

Excellent\! Now leave me back to my meditation\!  
I highly recommend going to Bardtown. It will be of much assistance.

END MERUK DIALOG.  
Player heads down path toward Bardtown

[The player then gets to Krizzdo which offers to shoot them into the top of Bardtown](#bookmark=kix.7au98lx70tzh)

\=================================================================  
The player starts out in Rothigport on the east side of the harbor in front of the Fisher Guild house. They are near Ori Moonsails boat, so they could take passage to Padula Anchorite which will get them close to the wilderness

They are also close to Lathander McFenn who can give them some starting tips and some starting gear. Rothigport is “The City of Wood” since it was founded on timber trade and is built on docks which are made of wood; so Lathander gives them a set of wood tools and weapons.

Lathander, besides for the tools, can give them a little overview of the world,  
A decent amount about Songtide, and then more detail about Rothigport

In Song Tide, creatures will not attack the player unless the player attacks them. Once that type of creature is attacked by the player enough, that type of creature will consider the player an enemy and then always attack them on sight.   
If they are in the Outlands it is different. In the Outlands, if the player is new for 2 days, the creatures will not attack them, but only defend themselves. Once the player is past 2 (real world) days old hostile creatures will attack the player.  
In Song Tide all creatures live in relative peace, except for the Snarlbush Formoris who raid ships that pass through. The creatures of Song Tide are more sentient and intelligent than most other realms. Creatures are stronger and have better loot, but the consequences of killing them is often higher. For instance, the player will likely lose karma, unless they are at war with that creature. Creatures that are allied with the slain creature may find out about it and spread the word of the players aggression. The gods that the slain creature worships may look down upon you and curse you in other ways later in the game. 

In the city of Rothigport, the player can meet some introductory characters that teach them things.  
**Magprythymo** the Crow Mage \- Can give the player the class of mage and teach them the Gust spell  
**Vermardi** the Mouse Thief- Can give the player the rogue class and teach them one stealing skill  
**Horgavid** , the Badger can give the player the warrior class and teach them one fighting skill  
**Pardieu** the Fox cleric can give the player the cleric class and teach them one prayer  
The player can only learn these four classes here and must find the Drifter class and Ranger class outside of the city docks.  
The player can also learn fletching/bowmaking, blacksmithy, herbalism,   
The trades of gardening can be learned elsewhere

To get more learned spells:

	The Forest Seers: Blossom, 

	Rosage: Spark

Fritz Lafrafop is the barkeep at the Whistlepig Pub at the NE side of the harbor in Rothigport

He is a generous host and amiable at most times. But if you get to know him well, he will start to open up and talk about his dismay at his daughter Penny’s state. She sits at the bridge and looks out for her lost lover, Braid, who went off to fight in the wars of the Central Kingdom colonies. He ever came back, and was reported dead, by survivors. Penny was lost and could not recover. Fritz thought she might throw herself off the bridge and succumb to the depths of the harbor, but she just stand on top and looks North, the direction he left and where he would return from. 

Now Penny was given a ring from Braid, when he promised he would return. Penny took this deep to her heart and thought the promise was a immutable desire that would be fulfilled. When she dropped the ring into the harbor from her many nights looking out from the high bridge, her forlorn increased and she was in a heartbroken stupor. 

Fritz knows of his daughter’s fiance’s murderers and is looking to mobilze a small group of fighters to go and avenge her loss. He is looking for the best warriors in Rothigport. He is not one, but he will send this group across The Long Sea to at least find out more information about his death and bring rest to his soul.

He gives hints to this, but he won’t activate until you bring him the ring, and are part of party of at least four. The more the better he says. He will commandeer a boat, that will bring you to the Central Kingdoms colonies, outside the Phalloworn Mines, where the Phalloworn Battle of took place only 2 moons ago.

The mystery to find his exact killers is a quest and will introduce the players to the Central Kingdoms. 

## Pool of Haught

	The Water Elemental Mistforborl \- Waterball, or geyser (if they already have waterball) He is in the Pool of Haught which the entrance can be found west of Rothigport in a cave in the forest. If the player follows the northern coast, going north and west of Rothigport, they will find a small cove with a small water fall. At the source of that water fall is a small cave which leads to the Pool of Haught. 

Though Mistborforl is not modest himself, lets the players offer to the Shrine of Purity. If enough mortals do this, it may spare Rothigport from the Tempest which would overtake it.

Mistborforl was once one of the Guardians of the Great Forge, which is now occupied by the technopriests of Druvvenrog (and renamed Dane’s Crucible after the High Technopriest) when they defeated Skragamor, keeper of the Flame, and sent him deeper into the Abyss of the Nether.

When the player enters the Pool of Dissolute  they can make their way down to the other side, when they enter

Maxims etched into the stone:

“West of the City of Wood\<\&nl\>Rests a pond that could\<\&nl\>a mortal dive and swim\<\&nl\>and arrive to find him in a cavern lush\<\&nl\>the Guardian of scornful gush”  
Given to Rosage  
“

“Mine enemies be scorched by the lightning and tossed by the Tempest. May the pure be spared from the Storm”

By reciting this command phrase to open secrets

By completing this, it is one step of the Virtues quest

He has high HP and shoots a greater water ball.

It took the fishing industry to be slowed down, to finally take notice of the changes to this area of Deluvia. The fisherman were not happy that the fish weren’t biting or showing up in their nets. Had all the fish been fished? It was the Mystic Rosage the Potion Maker who first consulted the Oracle at Omphalos to gain some answers. The Ley Lines that run through Deluvia are being changed by Deluvia herself with the Great Unstiching or Great Severing. This exemplary work by Rosage, who was just not yet a veteran mage, gained the attention of Nax Hollum. Nax made Rosage his apprentice and they, together, set forth to discover more about mysteries of this Great Sundering.

One of the disturbances causing this, that Rosage or Nax or any of the Arch Mages of Song Tide don’t know about, is the defeat of the Great Skragamor, molten titan of the Nether. It sent  Deluvia into an unbalance. Another disturbance is the rise of the mortals. The mortals are descendents of Deluvia, but they have fallen out of balance with nature. One of these reasons is certainly Druvvenrog, but Rothigport itself and the pride of the officials has also driven this. No mortals realize this yet.

## The Dirt Kingdom

The Dung Beetle Dirt Kingdom

Stercortrupes \- The Beetle Prince  
The player can get to the Carapacubicular Humilitas  (The chamber of Humility) by the Deep Caves of Song Tide.This is part of a much larger cavern network called the **Fungal Underground.** The entrance is at the far end of the Glistal Cave and the altar entrance is located there and through a tunnel they enter The **Chamber of Meeks** where they will immediately see the Ponds of Penitence. They are actually the Shamelshroom, so called by the stercus beetlefolk, and can increase a player’s karma and release some sins from other quests. In this chamber they can also collect nectar from some of the mega flora if they need. The draggleflap swarms overhead usually leaving the player alone  
**Meeks** is a Badger Clan druid monk and acolyte of **Putref** one of the mycelium goddesses. Meeks is an Anthoran who seeks isolation, but helps players that have come into these caverns. She can teach the cleric spell of **Decomposition**, which allows corpses to be absorbed into the soil immediately. (useful to keep necromancers from using the corpses). She also can give a mushroom tea that gives agility and staves off exhaustion for the day.  
Meeks will buy rotten flesh, mushrooms, or many of the drops in the chamber.  
Meeks is not in his hut when the player first arrives. But if they have collected mugstool, and put it in a bowl and cook it into soup on his stove, he loves the smell and will come to his hut to get it. He is grateful to you for making his favorite meal , Mugstool Stew, and will now help you.  
Meek also gives the magical item **The Wand of Soil’s Calm**, which does dirt magic damage, physical damage, chance at Bury spell, **Cancel Quake** cleric spell, and temporarily lowers fame and charisma while being held.  The player can attain this Wand if they fulfill Meek’s request to tell her brother, Roganth, that she is safe and not to worry about her, but not to tell her where she is. That she is on her own quest of purity and humility in service of Putref. Roganth is in Rothigport and if the player brings him one of Meek’s mushroom, that will unlock the wand. Meek’s other request is that the player give alms to the poor, at least one silver to 10 different beggars in Rothigport to show generosity and humility. Both of these are optional, but must be done in order for Meeks to give the wand.

*There also exists elsewhere in the world*  
*The **Wand of Soil’s Ire**, a wand that when held boosts the player’s charisma and fame temporarily, which can be useful with NPCs. When attained, though, will make the Dirt Elemental even angrier and more difficult. The Beetles will also think less of you and help you less. This wand enrages the Dirt Elemental Clodhaught if you ever knowingly attained it and are in his presence. This Wand can be found in the Dungeon of Vanity and Corruption (Livivinox Maculagnz Hor)*

A maxim is etched into the stone at Meek’s Hut

“Be grounded, prideful traveler. Know thy measure, Study thyself and Be Aware of thine place for confidence brings ruin.”

**Chamber of Perf** \- The Town of Stercuswarth, where is also the Altar of Perf. The demigod Perf was born of **Bref** the god of mud. Perf is the demigod of filth and decay and takes player’s vanity and absorbs it to recycle it back into the energy of Deluvia. Perf is a known god in Song Tide, but Perf does not wish not wish glory, but in fact seeks lowliness. This Chamber is named after him for he is the patron god of the Beetles. If you have not heard of him, he is pleased by this.

Another maxim in this chamber  
“Yield to the Storms of Dust and bow to the Gods of Decay. Know thy filth, bury thy vanity at the altar of Perf.”

The dirt elemental Clodhaught was conjured by Deluvia to keep Rothigport in check for its growing pride. Rothigport was founded on a sense of pragmatism and humility. He does not exist to harm or destroy Rothigport, but just as a check for its growing vanity and haughtiness. He took the form of dirt as a compliment to Rothigports respect for the sea. Also, Rothigport adopted the Virtue of Humility since that is the patron virtue of the Anthorans (Badger, Fox, mouse etc). The Anthorans were also formed out of mud by the gods and sages old fables say. When the water was separated to form the harbor around Rothigport, the dirt was left to do the work of building the town.There is a saying that a Rothigportian is not afraid to get their hands dirty.  
Rothigport was founded on hard work and Humility and respect for the sea. For 100 generations the Gods protected them from the sea.

This is Clodhaught’s way of offering redemption for Rothigport and its growing pride, but only if the residents of Song Tide do some penitent work, and that begins in Carapacubicular Humilitas. Clodhaught was summoned as a foil to Prigtoon, as a representative of the greed and rising pride and sins in this old town. 

The Stercus Beetle colony value humility as a virtue and hard work, burrowing tunnels under Song Tide, but for little reward. Though they are aware of Rothigport and Anthorans, they are unaware of Anthoran politics and ambitions. They feel the physical rumblings of those walking above, but make it none of their business. 

The Stercus colony are abiding to any visitors but are especially sensitive to lofty and vainful conceits. The higher your charisma and/or fame, the less they will help you. In fact, if too high, they will attack you until you are out of Stercuswarth limits.

The Path of the Humble:  
Beg for money in Rothigport \- give to 10 beggars

Seek the Shepherd \- There is Croknard, the shepherd out in the field with his sheep. If the player can help him herd his sheep they get this checked off

Ritual of Humility \- The Altar of Humility  
For it is always haughtiness that destroys those in power

The Dung Beetle Prince can give the player the Nadel’s Nostrum, a cure-all potion. He encourages the player to eat some dung. This also increases the player humility score.

If the player enters Clodhaught’s chamber without any introduction, he attacks them as he feels they don’t below in the Fungal Underground. Only the most humble of creatures can come to him. He sleeps for eternities without one visitor just feeling the tremors of mortals ambitions above.

If the player has an introduction from the Dung Beetle Prince, then he will offer to challenge them to a duel.

“I am light and I am heavy. I am strong enough to hold up a castle. I am fragile enough to be blown away in the wind. I am an anchor. I am a home. I am a sponge. I am one substance made of many different things. I am loose enough to flow like a river. I am solid as a mountain. I can be fertile. I can be barren. I am living and I am dead.”

Clodhaught, the Dirt Elemental casts quake, and quicksand. The player can cancel quake with the Wand of Soil’s Calm. If they time their jump right, they can miss the damage from quake. Quick sand will pull the player under slowly and make them very slow. They can move out of the way of the area if they are quick enough. If caught in the quicksand, they can counter act it with a speed poison. Of course if they save with a high enough dirt magic resistance, the spell will have less effect. Clodhaught is very slow so they should be able to see these coming.

The dirt elemental has to be beaten by simply lowering its HP. Water damage and poison damage will slow it down quite a bit to give a break for healing or gaining mana.

The dirt elemental cannot be killed but only subdued. He is just testing the players ability. Upon defeat he will give the player a choice between teaching them the quake or quicksand spell,  or the Ground Splitter warrior ability, or a mudstone gem

## Cavern (Dungeon) Vanitas – Livivinox Maculagnz Hor (poison dungeon)

The entrance is located just south of Mage town, or just north of Rystrilmyl  
The domain of Ratatoskel the Squirrel the sly messenger demon of poison. He considers himself the glorious champion of the Fungal Underground. He believes he is the greatest of demon gods, even though he was banished by Sifaneus from the aether to Vanitas to rule as a meer demi-god. He has gone crazy since living among the snakes and the rats and worms of the deep soil.  
The dungeon is an old poison mine and Mathor Dust production facility.  
Here a lot of dirt magic or dirt items will help the player to absorb poison damage. A high Humility score will help as well. Completing the Dirt Kingdom area first will help.

The mine had an explosion of the Mathor Dust several generations ago and all the workers had been poisoned and were presumed dead. The mine was sealed. The Goddess **Noxhortes** aided the monsters that formed because of the leaked poison as it was one of her goals for the blight to spread and affect Fecundia. She feeds Ratatoskel’s delusions about taking the highest position among the gods someday.

The player descends through the snake entrance mouth and goes down a winding passage where, at the bottom, they can see the central chamber mine. 

One way Noxhortes and Rataotskel plan on spreading her blight curses is with poison acorns called  the Allzeer Acorns. Ratatoskel buries them in the tunnels in the Fungal Undergrowth, hoping one takes root. Ratatoskel uses this tunnel from to sneak to the toplands on his way to the underdark

Here the player can defeat Vanitas and gain passage to Fecundia as these passages lead underneath the Great Tree Urd Drasil.  
Vanitas is a reminder of the morality of the creatures of Deluvia. This is the Age of Mortals after all, and Noxhortes, being a petty goddess, keeps this energy of Vanitas and Poison beneath Song Tide as a staging ground for Blight and destroying mortal knowledge and bringing mortal civilization back to a primal state. She keeps a bonfire in the chamber for mortals to come throw their knowledge into. In exchange throwing a book into the fire, she will unlock poison magic for the player.

Symbols include skulls, hourglass, wilting flowers, snakes/serpents, corruption, defilement 

The first chamber is Ophidi’s descent. The long walk is supposed to contemplate one’s mortality

The 8 poisons

* Blightox (dirt)  
  * \- Decay spell  
* Venomox (stone)  
  * Wyvern poison  
  * Purple worm poison  
  * Spider venom  
  * Snake venom  
  * Infectious Strike skill  
  * Serpent Arrow skill  
  * Monsters: snakes   
  * Paralyze spell  
* Mephinox (air)  
  * \- the entrance is in the ventilation shaft above the main room to the north west end. This vent stopped bringing fresh air in, which poisoned all the mine workers and released poisons into the chambers making the monsters extra mean  
  * Malice  
  * Essence of Aether  
  * Poison breath  
  * Monsters: Poison Elemental  
  *   
* Urushitox (nature)   
  * The entrance is located just off the South Central main room, just west of the control room.   
  * \- cicatrix \- healed wound  
* Amanitox  (mushroom/night poison)  
  * This magic is also hallucinogens that can give the berserker skill  
  * Paralyze spell  
  * Unconscious fighting skill  
* Taintox  (water)

  To enter into the Taintox room, the player must have Brackbotu’s breathing apparatus since the water is poisonous

  * Torpor	  
* Caustox (fire)  
  * Burnt fumes  
  * Flash Blindness  
  * Poison Burn spell  
  * Poison Field  
  * Oil of Corchem  
* Plaganox (death)  
  * Pale Tincture  
  *   
  * Monsters: Plague Beast

	Poison Elemental  
	

The Blightox room is in the SE corner  
The Taintox room is in the South Center off of the main room. It is in a mine well in one of the old control rooms 

The 7 chambers surrounding the main room, each give a poison weapon, poison spell, and raises the level of the main room. The main room’s level gets heighted by players completing things in the outer rooms and if it gets heighted enough, the champion spawn occurs in the middle chamber. When this champion, a mini boss, is defeated, the upper Toxic Fungal Underground is opened (all of the Severing Dungeons, are a connected network of huge tunnels under Song Tide and other realms. The player cannot always access them underground, but sometimes has to go to the overworld to find the other entrance. In some cases, they might have been given the secret to travel through the connecting passages 

There is also a cult that follows Noxhortes, which seeks to bring Rothigport back to a small village and rid it of its prideful culture. The main monk, Vonroll, leads this. He is just a patsy pawn to Noxhortes Vonroll is just a patsy pawn

Ratatoskel  
“You mortals bleed so easily, your flesh is weak. We are immortal”  
Allzeer Acorn   
The players will see Ratatoskel again later as the messenger in Kapasia. He escapes and seeks refuge there.

In the main chamber, if the players in the dungeon slay enough monsters in a certain period, a champion will spawn. There are levels that increase when the player kills enough monsters, then the level goes up and the monsters get harder. Poison monster levels

Ideas from Drehmal:

The landscape is just beautiful. Consider upping my game on environment/landscape for Songtide and Fecundia. Better trees and paths for example

The lore is cohesive [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x5yJmiRrWj227iC\_TAWSgdtmUeYS0SrI-EFWsAIGtwY/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x5yJmiRrWj227iC_TAWSgdtmUeYS0SrI-EFWsAIGtwY/edit?usp=sharing)

The primal caverns are a nice cave

Nice chapel and graveyard in Draybel   graverobbing mechanic

These towns might have good buildings to use for the Strongholds mechanic (eg the chapel) Mossfield

The moonlight sanctum might be a good start for a water temple boss

Good word is Desolate

## Quests

Quests are an organized way to give players something to do and be a part of the story in SteamFront. Though the word “quests” is usefully to talk about these goals, the word will not be used in the game except for a player’s epic journey to their ultimate goal. Words like Objectives, Achievements, Missions, etc. might be more useful words to use. In the game it is useful to talk about these things as participating in part of the story.

#### Type of Quests

* Combat \- defeat mobs  
* Agility \- parkour, scale walls, dodge boulders  
* Puzzles \- physical areas to manipulate items or blocks to find a solution  
* Maze \- navigate a maze  
* Riddles \- intellectual puzzles.   
* Lore Knowledge \- using areas of the story of Deluvia to find a solution. This can also relate to riddles  
* Deliver \- bring an item to an area or NPC. This could involve supply/demand goods  
* Escort \- escort an NPC to a new area  
* Obtain \- Fetch an item, or obtain a skill

A combination of any of the above. This list is not rigid and should be added to.

Quests and dungeons should always contain 

1. combat component  
2. narrative component  
3. puzzle component  
4. reward component. 

Each room of a dungeon, for example, can reinforce and contribute to these 4 components.

Quests will be added constantly and epic quests will be added at each Update.

Note that the game is about understanding the world and using the lore to solve problems; about being inquisitive and about rewarding the player for being curious about the people and places in this world. Objects are not just about stat gain, and quests are not just about gear and leveling. The goal is the change the way the player thinks about the world and get them to engage with it as a living thing rather than a game object. It’s also to encourage curiosity. It was built to get the player not only searching out the world in terms of physical space but also trying different interactions with NPCs in order to discover the historical or mythological space of this world.

#### Examples of Quest hierarchy

* Epic Quest \- quests that change the narrative and direction of the world  
* Personal Journey \- something that is unique to the characters but also can permeate into the world’s narrative  
* Race Quest \- each race gets an large quest that helps them discover the lore of their race and reunite with others of their race  
* Class Quests \- Each class will have at least one master quest to help the player learn their class skills and follow the paths of that class.   
* Class Specialization Quest \- In addition to normal class quest, when a player gets near maxing their levels in a class, they will be guided through another quest which helps them specialize a proficiency or dual class. For example, a rogue can now become an assassin and get uber assassin skills unlocked, but can no longer general thieve as well. That is to say, once a player starts to specialize in their class, the general class skills get neglected and are maxed and will not be as powerful as their specialization skills.  
* Playable Area Quests \- Each playable area will have at least one large quest that has to do with the lore of that area. For example. There should be a dungeon in each area that can be solved and grinded. There should also be a non-combat based quest in each area. Keep in mind making both solo quests and party-focused quests. Party-focused quests encourage each class for their participation.  
* Many medium-sized quests that involve, lore, economy and finding unique items.  
* Daily Quests \- small quests that reset daily that can reward the players for completing them  
* Economy Quests \- These are built into the supply and demand, but can be used by the administration to manipulate and kickstart the economy. An example of this is, find a place that sells gold low, and bring it across the world to where it is bought high.

Quests can overlap and unlock new quests from within them. For example, Epic Quests can have several medium-sized quests inside of them, some of which the players might think are independent and not even part of the larger quest. The smaller quest might also be part of several quests.

With all of the above it should seem as though there are a myriad of options for the players.

### Environmental Quests: 

These they find in the environment and not an NPC. This is a scene and the player must discover what the information around tells them to be able to start.

Everything is a task in the game. Every mob will be tracked and the player will get rewards that help their character (not just gold) Some of these can be titles. Eg, the player kills a lot of rats, they get the title Vanquisher of the Vermin. They could also get a special item or attribute.

## Dungeons

Dungeons are a type of quest and playable area, that and again is just a useful word to describe an area to be solved. The word dungeon, in-game, should be used as a jail in a castle.

Dungeons are solvable puzzles, usually with a boss or mini-boss that a group of players, or a player by themselves, can traverse to find and end result and get  treasure and skills. They are places that have secret passages, kill unique skilled NPCs, and retrieve rare artifacts. Dungeons maybe be permeable and in context with other non-dungeon areas, such as the sewer below New Pallamost but they may also follow the rules of seamless everworld, where they are whole new playable areas.   
Dungeons can also be assigned a Level in our documentation (but not in game), to describe the difficulty and the loot table to be assigned with it.   
Dungeons may be a step in a larger quest, or be stand-alone. They may be themed as part of a quest, or themed with some other metanarrative.

# Epic Quests

Epic quests are very large in scope and should take several months of player time to complete. They involved major parts of the world and change the outcome of the world lore and game by the end. They should contain several other quests as part of them. These are highly competitive to complete, as only the player, or party, that completes them gets the final reward.

A new Epic Quest should be added at each major, whole number release.

# The Fisher King 

Location: All Worlds  
Pre-requisite: Azernath Kings   
The errant and ailing king of New Pallamost, find where he has gone and try to restore him to the throne and return New Pallamost to its rightful glory.

BACK STORY:

At the end of the Wars of the Third Age, the ailing king sent his only son, his heir into hiding as a baby.

Joyzil Greymayne, a once great and powerful king of a great and powerful kingdom is near death. The Wars have done their worst on his psyche, and the wounds he’s suffered are incapable of being healed. To guard against usurpers he has sent  his baby son far away, to live with peasants, where Joyzil stays and needs a constant supply of Aqua Vitae from the Kingdom of the Wood to stay alive.

Greymayne hardly holds court anymore and in his stead has named Ayrchek his minister plenipotentary to deal the many foreign matters in these dark times. This surprised most of the court as Ayrchek was a commoner from one of the conquested colonies, but grew up with Greymayne children, daughter Frandaye and the lost heir. Greymayne trusted Arychek more than any other advisor and thinks of him as his son, and where Greymayne stays locked in his castle, Ayrchek greets guests to the court and is out around town, and makes diplomatic missions to Kingdom of the Wood, gothigport and other kingdoms. His main goals are to keep a war from happening between gothigport and themselves, and to regain control of their most recent and largest colony, Ghazmelestine, far in the western wild. Pallamost has run out of resources and this is their last hope to return to greatness. Ghazmelestine, though, is cursed and now just a parched desert, but many of the techno-prophets say there are great riches under the land.  
There are a lot of threats to New Pallamost in Ghazmelestine, since they were invaders and the local villages despise them. The close advisors think that this is where the heir was sent. 

No one knows where the heir was sent except Frandeye and the heir’s attendant, Threskin, who spies on the heir from afar. Even the Heir himself does not know his destiny. Greymayne doesn’t even know if his heir is still alive.

Ghazmelestine blames the king for the curse and part of this quest is to return the heir back to the throne and remove the curse from Ghazmelestine making it again a fertile land, making the people their love the king once again.

REWARDS:  
The Player gets to marry Frandey (or Ayrchek) and be on the court to the new Heir. They become sergeant of their own legion of the Pallatian Guard, and possibly in line for the throne for themselves someday. Access to a portion of the crown jewels. A path to become King (or Queen)

## Shadow casting (by Cryptozoological)

\*NPC Black Robe\*  
"You there, let me ask you something... Have you heard of Shadow-Casting? No? Shadow casting is a mystical and dark magic that has corrupted the hearts of many and have at the same time given many power. Would you like to try and become one? This is not for the faint of heart; the shadows will probably engulf your soul and send you mad... If you do decide to meet me outside the back of the Temple of Paladins. There follow a path to the left and meet our group in a small out-cove where the arches of this world shield our presence..."  
\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
"Ah\! So glad you have actually decided to show up. You and four others have come the other twelve were unfortunately 'missing' after they attempted to warn others... You aren't a spy are you?"  
**No...**  
"Hmm true you don't look like a spy... Anyways, I believe you have what it takes to make it in the world of Darkness... Just a few things I have to tell you and you'll be on your way to power. Our code is:  
***Darkness before Light, Death is expected for the Weak, Power is for those who'm are strong and Glory will be claimed by those who run chaos and havoc through the lands. Blood is Shadow; The Heart in Abyss, Mind of Fate, and Shadow Conquering Light forever…***  
 With this code you shall become a powerful Mage and remember trust no one that is held in captivity by darkness. Do you accept to this code?”  
**Yes**  
“I high noble of the kingdom under ShadowTide title thee… **Shadow Novice** If you break said code may Darkness consume your soul perishing into Eternal Horrors of the existence of eternity.”  
\*\*Note that I have to be notified when someone become this rank.\*\*  
“I will send word to the Lord of Shadows… Make your way to his kingdom. This will not be an easy task, you by the time you will get there you will know what the Code means and magic will be learnt along the way go to New Pallamost where your ship will be waiting for you… Things have been going to smoothly there in the docks so may chaos live. Conquering Light to give Shadow…”  
Hint: Read this when you get to New Pallamost.  
*Go to the Docks and look for the red and black flag on a Demonic Warship… Seek out the Captain…   (background lore: The Demonic Warship, the Soul Griefer, is an infamous warship left over from the Old Wars of the Third Age; it was infamous for a rumored pact, its captain at the time, and now since tried and hanged, General Grisvilwor, made with dark forces to repel the gargoyles back. It was the first of its kind as during this war, air power was first to be used and gave huge superiority to those that used it. (it created some equal footing to the gargoyles who could already fly themselves). This story has been lost though, because most of the veterans from the war murmur in the pubs  with stories gone by, and the youth of today, with their newfangled fob watches, take no heed and ignore the stories of the veterans and dismiss them as insane.) SB*  
Upon arriving at New Pallamost – Docks players will see a large Demonic Warship with a Fallen Angel on the docks. Upon talking to him you say;  
“Are you the Captain of this vessel?”  
“Yes I am the proud and victorious Fallen Angel you can call me Fallang. I am a five star of the thirteenth division of the Demonic Class HoverShip guarding his royalty the High Minister of War through Logistics and Diplomacy. He is currently talking to the Dux here and will be conversing with the Technocrats in the Northern Islands. But enough about me I know why you are here… You need to go to the Lord of Shadows Kingdom… ShadowTide. He is undefeatable the only weakness he has is his father, The Dark Father but his real name; is Carl… Anyway, I will take you to the Kingdom on our way back, just go get the Minister he is almost done. Let me teach you something first it may come in handy.”  
\[|| New Skill: Sap (Saps health from opponents over time for 1 second costs 1 mana does ½ heart) ||\]  
New Quest\! Go to the King’s Castle in New Pallamost and talk to the Minister of War.  
Hint: He’s on the top floor of the tower with a beacon.

## Forbidden Rising (By RogueSpartan)

In the main quest-line, the player discovers that there is a rising power called the Forbidden Truth trying to ascend their leader to become a god, through dubious sacrifices. The main quest-giver will provide the player with a pretty straightforward goal, but with multiple possibilities. 

Beginning: The Origins of War

“In the North, there is a group growing in power. They call themselves the Forbidden Truth. Apparently they want to become gods or something. I don’t really know all the details, but hey, if you want to figure it out, go ahead.”

Decision: Divided 3 ways, go to the capital of each kingdom and find an attendant of the court to give you more information on how bad the Forbidden Truth is, and how they’re trying to stop it, so you have to join them, blah blah blah.

OR: Travel north and come across one of their sacrificial temples, and get inducted as a member by killing an NPC.

Key decision: To Kill a God

This one is a bit trickier, as it has 4 different possibilities. 3 depending on your kingdom, and 1 if you’re part of the cult. 

Decision: Once more, 3 ways depending on your kingdom. It works sort of like rock paper scissors, as each kingdom has one that they are hunting, and one that they are hunted by. For example, Faith attacks Progress, Progress attacks Tradition, and Tradition attacks Faith. I’ll flesh out the reasoning for each later, especially when we write out NPC quest dialogue. The Gods that are being hunted are the Deluvic ones listed above. Depending on Kingdom alliance, you will hunt one god for a piece of their soul to return them to their realm of origin (Endaric or Aetheric) so they can no longer exist in Deluvia. I think upon reaching the god, there will be two options available to the player. One, will be simply to fight the god a PNPC that will result in the drop of the soul shard (a renamed end crystal). The other option is to do it completely in roleplay, essentially trying to convince the god to hand over their shard as the player is considered worthy. I see this going three ways depending on the boss. Progress (God of knowledge) requires a hefty Intelligence stat, Traditional (God of Leadership) requires a strong Charisma stat, and Faith (God of War) requires a strong Strength stat. 

OR: As this is a much less desirable path by players, the difficulty and yield will be much higher. Every player in this path has to defeat not one, but all three of the gods, retrieving their shards to sacrifice to the cult leader for ascension. 

Final section: Ending Ascension / Gods Among Us

This is the final result of the questline, and a turning point for the history of the game. It is actually a large server event, held for multiple weeks during probably a month or so, and it is basically a massive PVP event. After the decisions of the prior quests, the players will be tasked to defeat or defend the cult leader during his ascension ceremony. Now, here’s where it gets interesting. The Cult Leader boss (PNPC) will be given extra armor, health, and even weapons, based on how many shards were retrieved by players allied in his quest line. The fights will take place in the weeks before his ascension, as the kingdoms are trying to weaken him before he has a chance to ascend. The battles will be between 1-8 player teams from the kingdoms, versus 1-4 player teams from the cult \+ the cult leader boss. Now, the kingdom teams also have a benefit on their side. Depending on which god was killed the most, the players from every kingdom will receive a special weapon that emphasizes that god’s powers. 

Results: Should the Kingdoms succeed and weaken the boss enough to a point where he cannot ascend, they shall be victorious, and the players will get an extra reward from their kingdom of choice, along with the rewards gained if they or their party defeat the cult leader.

OR: Should the Kingdoms fail, the Cult leader shall ascend to god status, and enter the Aetheric realm. As a reward for their compliance, he gives his followers an extra reward on top of what they gained if they or their party defeated the onslaught party. 

Lore changes: This is a big one. As this concludes chapter one of the server, we will add in the results of player decisions into the lore. 

The Kingdoms- The Kingdom that had the most success (quest completion) will be deemed the most powerful of the period, and the other two shall also be labeled in kind. 

The Gods- The god that was killed the most will now be considered bound to his prior realm. He will no longer exist in Deluvia, essentially leaving a void for the Kingdom that benefitted from that god the most.

The Cult- This one hinges entirely on the results of the event. Should the Kingdoms succeed and trump the cult leader, the cult will become less influential, and the leader will eventually begin looking into other methods to ascend, leading to the decline of the cult following through the years. The more interesting scenario is if the cult succeeds and he ascends. If he manages to ascend, he will take his place as the new god of the occult, embodying all that is involved with sacrifice and blood magic. He is considered the god of contracts, and will become perhaps something for a later quest-line. 

## RedFoot the Werewolf 

(Maelusmoth) \- one of the NPCs is accused of a murder spree but the player can find who has really been murdering characters in the town the past few moons to , and it is RedFoot, who was thought to be long dead, but is back to rend his wrath upon the town. The players want to prove their friend innocent and prove the real murderer is RedFoot, though the townsfolk don’t want to believe.

They should fit in the the lore.

## Tower of Wrath

**Location: Wildlands**

## Jutrollag Basilica

 (Kalimvane)  
 This is the first dungeon the players might encounter. This was the first settlement of the Jutrollag pilgrims who set up the big basilica in honor of their god Expitik. Expitik has long gone from the basilica and all that are left are monsters. 

BACKSTORY: Expitik is a good goddess and was outcast from gothigport when they turned their backs on gods and magic long ago.   
The Jutrollag Union Brotherhood was an old and respected guild at gothigport. Terriss was the lead cleric and Uftan was his cupholder. This was at a time when there were many guilds on gothigport and many had their own religions.   
gothigport started to dive deeper into technology after the Wars of the Third Age. Any type of arcane thinking was shunned and Expitik was the first to go, as she was most nature-based diety on the islands. Once her holy tree was cut down she fled and her followers were massacred by a techno-cult mob. Expitik and the escaping Jutrollags came to Kalimvane and founded and built the basilica in her honor for delivering them through the deluge and Dreadstorms.   
Terris was their loyal leader and powerful in Expitik miracola (miracles). Uftan was his protoge but wanted the miracola faster than Terris would allow. Becoming impatient, Uftan went back to gothigport, which in the short 11 years, had become a crawling techo-conurbanation, seeking forgiveness and acceptance. He met secretly with House Grimstok which he made a bargain to become a lackey in the House if he gave up his religion and miracola. He did, for 2 years but longed for Kalimvane, the Jutrollag’s and Expitik. He voyaged back to Kalimvane and stole the automaton Thegot from the Grimstok factory. When he reached Kalimvane, Terris was dead, murdered by the native barbarians of Kwinst. Uftan was so overcome with pain that he and Thegot, who he had to reprogram, went on a revenge murder spree of the Kwinst. For this Expitik had no pity and banished Uftan from the basilica. Some of the Jutrollags followed Uftan to build the town at the current location it is now. Expitik left the basilica with the rest of the followers to an unknown location. She cursed the basilica and the area to be overrun with monsters. Uftan and the rest of the citizens built walls and a moat around the city to help keep the monsters at bay.   
Now Uftan prefers this history to be hidden and never spoken of. Only the original members of the Jutrollags, which there are 3 others, know the story. Everyone else in Kalimvane are newcomers. He has made Kalimvane into the trading center of that region of the Eastern Rim though, because of the monsters, commerce is suffering.   
He wants to make sure that House Grimstok can’t find him. He has a lot of worries on his mind.

The other three members from the Jutrollags are Vanfang, who went off to found the thieves guild; Bildagar, who is now a hermit in the Boarsback; and Gregari, a merchant in the town. By finding and talking to all three of these, and completing the Jutrollag Basilica dungeon, will open up the quest to discover this mystery.

For now, all the player knows is this is a simple trading town. And all they know is that the basilica is a monster haven

# Wanderer: Seeking the Twelve

Twelve quests, each one embodying the aspects of the Twelve Elder Sages of Deluvia, who were the first to arrive in Deluvia after the Age of Gods.  
The player can start in any order, though some are harder than others, and by the end, they must choose one Elder Sage to bind to and complete a thirteenth quest which gives them.

Any classes can choose one of the Elder Sages to seek, but the Wanderer gets to seek all twelve.

The Twelve Elder Sages hold the physical world together with their combined virtues. They imbue their virtues into objects in the physical world that can manifest themselves into abilities and knowledge.  
Travelers in Deluvia can obtain knowledge of the virtues of the Elder Sages by making a pilgrimage to one of the Elder Sages. Each pilgrimage is fraught with danger as each Sage secludes themselves and purposely makes themselves difficult to locate to test the will and worthiness of each pilgrim.  
The Twelve Sages were the creators gods gift to the races as the end of the Second Age dwindled to provide their virtues from themselves onto the next progeny. Only the three original creator gods participated in which is why it is a direct line to them, and other virtues exist from the whole pantheon that are not listed here.  
The Twelve Sage:  
The First: The first to come into the Third Age. The conceiver of Knowledge.  
The Aggressor: The first to strike and see opportunity. The wielder of physical power and cunning to gain territory for their fellow clan.  
The Cleric: Seeks balance through transformation and commune with gods.  
The Leader: Holds power to sway their fellowkind to greatness in battle and to govern.  
The Judge: Finds fairness through discernment  
The Free Spirit: Not beholden to any other law. Finds strength in serendipity.  
The Warrior: Has skill in battle and tactics.  
The Prosperous One: Has much land and coin.  
The Scholar: The holder of knowledge from books.  
The Merchant: The crafter and seller of goods. Makes good deals.

## Bander’s Tale

“It's a topsy, turvy world”, Bander thought as he sat perched on his favorite high spot in the Krucikruss Rookery district of Druvenrog. He was the lookout for his gang, the Corvidroods, one of many groups of misfits that worked outside the law. He saw his friends, Trale and Kataryss down below in the market square, pulling their stunts as some of the best pickpockets on this side of Northtop Mountain.  
From this vantage point he could see everything that was going on in the market down below. Gark Businessmen in their frock jackets, top hats and canes would come down from the high city to make new deals among the factories and docksides. They didn't know that all the local’s eyes were on their breed when in this working class sector of the city. Those in the gangs, all felt that the Gark’s had it coming. It was plundering from the rich to give to the poor. Mingling among the patters and shoppers of the working class, these Garks sure stood out and definitely showed nerve flaunting their riches.  
Bander thought they would use any money that his gang “earned” for various repairs on their  skiffrunner for the next race or to bribe off  The Brownclads or to pay tribute to gangs higher up the food chain than them. “This will be our last theft”, Bander hoped.  He didn’t like that they had to do all the thieving, but the reality of survival in this over populated town meant that there weren’t enough resources to go around.  
There were so many gangs now, Bander thought. Over a hundred at his last count; and that's in Krucikruss alone, though the domain of a gang was fluid as the borders of boroughs, sectors and neighborhoods were constantly being redrawn. They had their own, self-described territories that went outside of the lines that The Corporation drew. How far up and down did the authorities’ borders go anyway, Bander thought? It was as though the farther layers down one resided, indicated their stature and likelihood to not stay alive.  
Enough worrying about the Garks and Krats for now, he thought, disrupting his daydreaming, as he saw some potential trouble approach the situation. “This is exactly why we always have a lookout”, thought Bander.  
 In the large crowd gathered in the marketplace on the docks on a busy afternoon he saw The Security Enforcement Patrol Apparatus pushing their way through the people and headed straight for Trale and Kataryss.   
The Security Enforcement Patrol Apparatus,  is like the army and police all in one. They were the combined forces of all the Houses of Druvenrog meant to keep peace on the islands as well as out on the high seas surrounding the region. They were always outfitted with the best tech and put a damper on all the gangs activities. The gangs called them Brownclads, the brown armor they wore.  
Bander’s friends just pulled off their deed of relieving these gentlemen Kratters in the marketplace of some weight of their purse and watches. No one was any the wiser for it except The Security Enforcement Patrol Apparatus seemed to know. They always know.  
Bander sent down the usual message, a bird whistle that was only recognizable by the Corvidroods, down through the spires of smokestacks and buttresses; and Kat and Trale heard immediately this sound they had practiced a dozen times. Trale and Kat knew what to do. Trale jumped up to see through the crowd and he saw Brownclads looking back at him coming at a faster pace trying to part the unwitting and increasingly scared bystanders. Bander saw all of this and started his descent to the planned strategic points they had practiced and help out his pals.  
The chase was on\! Trale and Kat headed dawn-to, away from Brownclads (The Security Enforcement Patrol Apparatus), which were six, heavily armed men in their typical clunky uniforms, with every gadget The Corporation could outfit them with. A disadvantage, at least most thought so, because in every entanglement with Brownclads the crooks would always just weave them through all the tight spaces found everywhere around the cities, such as sewers, pipes, tight alleys; that was the gang's advantage; they knew the city very well. They all knew the districts better than any authority did and could navigate all the nooks and spaces far better than they could, especially with all their goofy gear. Now their gear could be lethal, there's no doubt about that, but they were never going to use it in the crowds, and even when in an entanglement in a narrow alley with angles and curves, none of that brute force was going to work against the elegance of speedy feet and teamwork.  
One would think they would catch on that the gangs had others on the lookout to help out with such operations. They seem like roboids, unable to think about things like that. Maybe they *were* roboids. Though they looked like men with the bit of skin you could see, they certainly behaved like roboids. Bander wondered what kind of beings would even want to join Brownclads.  
The Covidroods had rehearsed this scenario at least 20 times, and we weren't going to screw it up this time. Bander was to slide down one of the buttresses at the corner of Soor and Brack streets and open the detachable cover on the inspection chamber shaft just in time for Trale and Kat to slide in. He would follow and replace the cover behind him. Down he went, sliding down the iron rail on top of a buttress holding up this tower. The worn leather on the soles of his shoes was the perfect texture to slip down and still maintain his balance. The buttress direction was pointed exactly toward the chamber shaft opening, so it was all about timing. Trale and Kat were running as fast as they could through the crowd and he watched them, changing his speed slightly so that he would get there just a second before them. It was a 10 foot drop from the end of the buttress to the street, so at the end he jumped off and landed with a somersault to break his fall. As he came up he grabbed the handle of the iron cover, yanked it up just in time for Trale and Kat to jump down. A couple more seconds he was down after them and pulled the cover shut, all the while hoping Brownclads or their informants hadn't seen any of this. They ran like the nether down the tunnel and didn't look back, hoping they didn't get followed.  
And follow Brownclads did not. If Bander and his gang had another lookout, they would have all loved to see the faces on the six Brownclads stooges face area. Alas, their gang was only three, but a thick three. They all grew up together on the streets as orphans, stealing their way to survive in the grimey layers of Druvenrog.  
They took a different way down through the labyrinthine pipes and sewers each time to avoid letting any potential followers know a direct way to their fort. They turned a corner and there was Stiney. Trale was leading and bumped right into his chest and fell backward, having me and Kat trip right over him. Stiney was from a rival gang and was not fully human. That is, he was mixed with other species to give him his mass and height, which they knew better than to tamper with. Trale did the usual and handed over their take from the recent pickpocket raid. Stiney just laughed and they moved on. Stiney wasn’t a bad bloke, or from one of the bad gangs, he was just collecting tribute for them pass through his “territory”. In some ways it was worth it, because he would have been on The Corvidroods side if Brownclads was following. Bander has seen him take a dozen Brownclads on at once and win\!  
After a few more corners they all stopped and confirmed that they still had the majority of their take stuffed in their boots and only gave Stiney a small portion. They considered the “donation” a small price to pay to be surrounded and associated with gangs that were, more or less, their mates.   
Three was a very small number for a gang in Krucikruss District. From some of the other meetings of the games I've attended, some gangs have hundreds of members. Some of them are working together, some of us are in competition, and others are in deadly war against each other. The Corvidroods were none of those. Though some of the more unsavory gangs would probably like us dead for the small piece of the pie we dip into, which isn't much, believe me. Our take today would allow us a feast tonight; a feast to celebrate the end of the world, and then some small upgrades on my skiffrunner.  
Most gangs steal the parts they need for their skiffs, skiff jumper, skiffrunner, soojchaser, whatever they want to call them these days, as they all have the same goal of going as fast as you can down the canals of the districts of Druvenrok; but the Corvidroods don't rob their goods from the skrappers. They're good folk the skrappers. They're one of the good guys. . . usually. Only take what we can from the Kratters and Garks and then buy from the skampers, skrappers junkers and patters, what we need. It's a verifiable black market down there under the cities. Don't tell The Corporation that though. Those Kratters don't need to know nothing. Though some say they know everything.  
The buying of parts was for tomorrow. Tonight  we feast. Far below the chamber shafts in the old factories that Krucikruss was built on we had our cozy little hangout among the old bricks and iron of the old city where we carved out a home. The threat of being found by Brownclads is always looming. We hear about it happening all the time to other rival gangs, but we are so far down, and so far back from anything and everything that the Brownclads wouldn't see it worth their effort to even try to find us.  
Krucikruss Rookery is the fourth largest district on Druvenrok Island. Golgime City, where most of the Kratters live, is the biggest, and Dunsbay Tallow, all the way on the other side of the mountain, is the second biggest. Druvenrok the third. I've lived here my whole life, never venturing far enough out to see much of the rest.  In my 15 years of life I've seen most of the change that's happened here though, and with all the progress the Kratters are making. They lay the most recent layer of the city on top of the rubble of the last. That leaves plenty of secret lairs for the gangs to crawl around in down there find haven and never (hopefully) be found. The network of pathways criss-crossing up and down and back and forth can even get me second-guessing where I'm going.  
After eating far more than my fill from the roast and the crobb and the endless spalet, I sit back in my makeshift bed which is more or less a fancy hammock; as Kat dances through the night to Trale's fiddle playing. We're all sore from all the antics today, but it was a good day. We made a small haul and stayed alive for just one more.  
---

The rumblings from the down below woke me again. The island seems highly unstable to those of us that live below. The tremors used to occur once a month or so, and now they are every day or more. It's the endless construction and the layers of old city beneath new factories providing less than the needed support. The buried city settles and shifts and quakes. None of my worries. I hop out of hammock and take my share of coin from the previous day’s take and head  up to the surface for a day of shopping from the skrappers.  
It takes a while before I see light. The pathways go every which way and are like a web, but eventually I am out, using a different exit every few days to make sure The Security Enforcement Patrol Apparatus hasn't staked out one of the many entrances or exits to the underdeep. The underdeep is the gangs slang for all of the carved out areas of the mountains and sewers and old city ruins that create an endless network of maze.  
Today I'm  off to meet up with Skrin, a skrapper that probably has the piece I'm looking for to outfit his skiffrunner. Skrappers are merchants that roam the Long Sea for derelict craft and take what they find useful to sell in the cities. Sometimes they spend months out there and no one ever knows if Skrin is coming back. I like him because he doesn't try to scam, like so many patters do. A patter is any merchant on Druvenrok; so skrappers are often patters as well, just with the additional skill of scavenging. A skamper is pretty much the same thing as a skrapper but probably less knowledgeable about what they're selling. That is, a skamper doesn't go out on the Long Sea to do the salvage.  
Then there is the gin tuner. I'm one of those, or hope to be. I'm constantly working on my skiffrunner to try to make it faster and faster to compete in the nightly races in the canals. A few of skrappers are also gin tuners, which has them save some of the best junk for themselves. That's why I try to pay the highest coin I can, and that's why I have to resort to crime to get my coin.  
Trale and Kat have their own goals that they spend their share of the take on. Trale is saving for his own ship someday. At the rate he's going it will be decades. He hasn't ever been off Druvenrok either, but his dream is valid. Kat is trying to get into one of the many firefighting unions here on Druvenrok. They are a respected trade, as the daily fires threaten the burgeoning industries. To get into one of these unions is tough and often inherited. Both Trale and Kat want to be legit someday. I  just wants to get better at his gin tuning.  
One of these days he'll  win enough races to have a fortune and buy Trale his ship, and buy Kat bribes to get into the Union and he will put a small house on one of the small islands on the outskirts of Druvenrok. Or farther. If there is anything farther.  
Skrin is in today just as I hoped. He gives me the nod when he sees me coming. The nod that means he's found some good junk from his last haul and that the coast is clear from Brownclads. He probably figures I have coin too, and is eager to make some coin of his own. He knows how I come to my coin. He knows how I hope to change and get it legitimately someday. He hopes to get it from bets on the races, rather than stealing but, he thinks the Kratters deserve it just like I do.  
I give Skrin the usual shoulder bump. He's always so glad to be back on land and ready to make some coin. So you got any amplisaddle injector coils Skrin?, I ask him. I'll take all that you have. Skrin usually gives me first dibs. He believes I can win the races someday. He bets on me and my skill. I've been gin tuning for 9 years now, helping skrappers and gin tuners since I was a small boy, learning the craft. Tonight's race will be extra tough, because parts of the improvised course will go through some new canals on the western coast. I've never been there, and one of the keys of winning, is not only one's gin tuning skills, but also knowledge of the city canals and rivers, the shortcuts and bypasses that show up.  
No one knows them all. Druvenrok, the name most of us call the conglomeration of islands grouped together, seems like one big city on one big island, but started out as small towns, far away from each other. House Grimstock lived upon Northtop mountain and were even the richest back then. When the great storms came and buried most of the mountain in water, only the families at the top survived and became what are now the ruling houses. See\! I know my history.  
Now that there is this huge city sprawling across the whole of the islands, all the rivers in between serve to get us criminals quickly around from city to city, island to island. Then there are the dug canals that blend seamlessly between rivers; and all of the tunnels and sewers. Us ginners call this 'the Web', because it criss-crosses in all directions, but also because the spiders, The Security Enforcement Patrol Apparatus, is always lurking trying to catch us.  A map of the Web would be super helpful but to my knowledge, no one has drawn one yet. It doesn't help that new structures are being raised every day and old ones taken down. Perhaps I will make a map someday, to help future ginners. Tonight will be my first venture outside of the Krucikruss and the beginning of my exploration of all the Web, of which thorough knowledge is crucial to ginner success.  
As I think I indicated, Brownclads has their ginners too. I don't think they call them that, but they are out there in the Web. They all look the same so they're easy to spot, but they're fast. So fast that they often crash. They don't know how to tune their skiffrunners to handle the banks and turns. Some of my buddies in other gangs have told me that Brownclads has started to disguise their skiffrunners like the gangs in order to entrap us, so I'm always on the lookout. For now I will still scavenge their wrecks for the best parts, if there's anything left. The best scrappers don't scrap in the city limits because The Corporation outlawed it. They do their best work out on the Long Sea. Someday I'll get out there too.  
Tuning a gin takes a lifetime to master, so I have a long way to go. Still, some of the gamblers put their money on me because they see my potential. I hope they're right someday. I haven't won a race yet, but am getting close. Heck, I've only done circuits in Krucikruss yet; then again, I know these routes well. But I figure when I get out among the hundreds of kilometers of the Web I can really utilize my skills. Then there are others of the watchers who doubt my abilities. It was only once when the course went down a tunnel straight west and towards sewers of Gozon and I panicked and crashed my craft into the wall. It was my first time in something that narrow, and the thought of Gozon creeped me out. If you crash your craft in there, the goblins will scavenge your craft for who knows what before you can swim out of the water. Some tuners have even gone missing in there. So that was my one time I flopped on the race and didn't finish. I won't let it tarnish my record and I will keep on racing and eventually winning.  
Skrin takes me to his back room away from the dock that is on the main canal. He runs a legit business in the front, but most of his coin comes from contraband, in which he is just about to show me. We go down some stairs and then turn right down some more to his skrapper workshop where he works on craft and gins. He steps on a lever on one particularly huge gin and part of it raises up making a path through the middle. He turns around to make sure no one else followed us and then knocks a secret know on a rusted iron door that blends in with the rest of the iron on the wall behind the gin. A slot opens and two greasy eyes look and then the door opens.  
This is the first time I've been back here. Either things are getting harder for the skrappers with their contraband or he is beginning to trust me more. He usually would hand me the part on his main dock, but now I'm thinking that this part must be on the blacklist with The Corporation.  
He leads me down some more stairs. I know we are now in the first sub-level which is part of the Old City. We call it the Old City because it is where one of the original cities was before the Corporation started building all their new factories and buildings for the last war. They are a semblance of buildings that have been crushed, some more recognizable than others. The sewers disrespectfully intersect with some of these buildings and mines have been dug under and through others. It is a huge, beautiful mess that us tuners and skrappers and any other folksters love for its seclusion from Brownclads (The Security Enforcement Patrol Apparatus). It's not like Brownclads doesn't come down here from time to time, but it is so rare that none of us sweat about it.  
I follow Skrin through the tight corridors with men and women in working outfits, leather bibs and aprons and full of grease jutting out of doors and in between steam gusts in the pipes overhead. We have to turn sideways to allow a gentleman tinker carrying a annsdrispam horopipe through  the hall. It was bustling down here. Down the hall a little further Skrin turns right and into a gray grimy room with no sunlight and only the sounds of gears cranking and water dripping from leaky pipes. "There", he says. "Sorry for all the walking, but I keep all the good stuff down here". "Understandable", I say.  
"I want to show you something", Skrin says. Skrin always wants to show me something. Some new piece to make my skiffrunner faster or control better, but he's never announced it before. So that made me a little nervous. I've known Skrin since I can remember and he never had this nervous look on his face under long, grisly, painter's brush mustache.  
In the back closet there was a table with a dropcloth over it, which Skrin grabbed from a corner and pulled it back and revealed something that I’ve never seen before. A gin lay on the table that was as large as my whole skiff.  
“Do you want it?”, said Skrin.  
“Cuss no” I whispered back to him so people in the rooms nearby couldn’t hear our conversation.  
“This kind of thing is now contraband, Skrin. It belongs to The Corporation”, I said.  
This was no ordinary trawler gin of the types that Skrin normally scavenges from The Long Sea, in fact normally he doesn’t find an intact gin at all, but some piece that might be useful in combination with others he finds leagues away.  
This one clearly belonged to a new class of vessel that none of us subcraggriat (below the cities) gangs would be experts in identifyin.  
“It belongs to an airship is my guess”, Skrin piped in.  
I looked around and covered it back up and wished I hadn’t seen it, not that anyone around would hear with all the clanging of rivit guns and hissing of steam pipes making all the noise they do.  
Curiosity really did get into me though, as Skrin knew it would, from one gin geek to another.   
“I found this out in the deepest deep” Skrin said.  
“I had some trouble dredging it up, as you could imagine. And even more trouble making sure none of the authorities saw me bring it ashore to here.”  
The Security Enforcement Patrol Apparatus was both brilliant yet stupid, precise yet slow, and; deadly yet blunt. Hundreds of black market goods make it past customs each day, but each time the skrappers risk their life, with their trade of hauling in salvaged goods. Sometimes The Security Enforcement Patrol Apparatus turns their eye the other way for a few coin, sometimes they stop every good coming in out of paranoia, and other times they are just lazy. But once and awhile, they make an example of someone, and that skrapper is rarely seen again.  
Skrin knows that he is still not safe now that he has it hidden deep in his yard, even in this small locked room. There are too many traitors willing to trade their hate for The Corporation for a few coin in reward. The Security Enforcement Patrol Apparatus has spies. And, word just simply spreads.  
“How many people have you shown this to?” I ask.  
“Just you and Chanks”, Skrin answers.  
Chanks is another ginner like me, but not a gin runner. That is to say, he likes to build and mod gins, but not race them. He’s more of a collector and trustworthy, but still competition for parts for me; and competition for building the fastest gin.  
The best ginners out there are runners that build their own gins from scratch with no team and no sponsorship from a gang. That’s where all the respect is.  
That’s what my plan is. To  do it all on my own. Well there is my fellow Corvidroods who help me pull heists to get some money; And then I do buy my pieces from Skrin and he gives me some deals once and awhile.  
“What do you think”, Skrin asks, “are you interested?  
“Of course I am”, I exclaim in toned down voice, “but you know I could never use this in my skiff”.  
Skrin knows that my interest in this piece is the same as his; not to make a faster runner, but to get one more piece of knowledge of what The Corporation has going on, To reverse-engineer their technology and get one more leg up on foiling their authority. And, to find out what makes airships tick.  
 The Corporation is the only organization that can build airships. It’s illegal on Druvenrok, for anyone other than them, to build or fly one and they keep the knowledge forbidden, like most everything else. In fact there are only three of the 13 Houses that built airships. Others have tried and been stifled. House Treychon builds smallish luxury yachts that gets sold to other House elite and Kratters. House Shrevemakis builds the huge war galleons. House Steedstoss builds the stylish varieties. All of them are very temperamental disasters though. That is, most don’t make many trips across The Long Sea and back before a crash. That doesn’t stop them from making them though; and it surely doesn’t stop people from using them. Having a good pilot,  good navigator and ginner on aboard make all the difference, making these occupations highly desirable. What type of ship this gin that Skrin found, I do not know.  Airships are not my specialty, and really no one else’s, as the three aforementioned Houses have a lock down on the tech.   
Some of my friends, from friendly rival gangs, who make a lot of their coin from espionage of the many industries give me some friendly tips and also let me know that the three Houses are constantly sabotaging one another for an edge on the other. So not only are the gangs and other anti-government organizations giving havoc to The Corporation; they are also secretly backstabbing one another. Knowing all this makes me long for a simple life of a ginner. I joke, mostly, because there is nothing simple about it.   
“I won’t take this gin”, I tell Skrin. “Not today”.  
“It won’t last long”, Skrin says. “I have a dozen customers that would love to have this at top dollar”.  
“I know”, I say.   
I also know how hot this contraband is and that it likely currently being searched for by its owner with the help of Brownclads. I have to stay out of it.  
“I have to stay out of this one”, I tell Skrin.  
“I get it pal”, Skrin tell me.   
I know he was trying to help me out and I feel bad I couldn’t oblige. I take a few small parts like a rotareezor, and nordicompass but save most of my coin for another day.

That night there is no race on the Web. I was just going to test out some of my new tunes. Tunes are what us gintuners call a new modification to our skiffrunners. I had my usual routes that I knew would avoid most Brownclads skiffs and rival gangs, but this one canal was blocked, which happens a lot, because with all the new construction, old routes get shut down and new ones open up. It’s hard to keep track of and pointless to make a map. The best ginrunners keep updating the map in their head, which is the main reason I’m on my pleasure cruise tonight. I turned my skiff around and see a rival gang, cornering me. I recognize from their sigl, that they’re from the Speed Knot Clan. I’m sure, besides for wanting to just mess with me, they also want my gin. Besides for buying from the skrappers, stealing is the preferred method of most gangs to get new equipment. I buzz through the only gap the three couldn’t cover and they buzz around to follow me. I hope my knowledge of the Web and ginrunning skills are better than theirs. When I peek back, I see two of them have taken a different route, and one stays on my tail. This makes me think they know the Web and some routes better than me, so I expect them to cut me off from a new path I don’t know about. I think ahead to try to improvise and surprise them. I remember a canal that was being constructed yesterday and almost finished. If it is finished, it would be a new route that no one should know. If it is not finished, then it is a dead end, and I would likely be dead, as I would have to take that corner so fast to lose them and no know if I would slam into a brick wall. There is no days off on Druvenrok despite the dozens of unions efforts, so I know they were hard at construction and I think there should be a 50/50 chance they they are finished.

# Kat’s Tale

No one knew how the fires started. It was before the ancestors’ came to our island and before the seas rose around us to take away most of the land, and

# The Frontier

Gryp's torch flame hardly stayed lit and twisted and righted with every gust from the riftwinds. He was covered in long, thick leather from the hides of a tarankacil, one of the many beasts a wanderer hunts to stay alive out on the rifts. This was common attire for a wanderer, used to block the cold strong winds in the night. His long gray hair wasn't enough for warmth so he wore a hood to stop the cold from his ears.  His boots were made of the same beast hides.  
The image of his companion, Fromm, appeared into Gryp's torch light which only cast a meter in front of him in the wavering, falling snowflakes. He wasn't that startled. Wanderers that far out on the frontier don't let anything under a few meters tall frighten them.  
Fromm was out in front, scouting in the dark, making sure that a rival hunting party wasn't tracking them. It was too dark this night from the blizzard that not even the moons’ light pierced enough to see ahead.  
Gryp and Fromm were two of some of the best hunters in the Riftlands. Just like most wanderers, they were also escaping the control of the Central Kingdoms and the petty rivalries found there, so that they could be free to claim land where they wanted and actually find resources without being taxed.  
It was their skill that let them be out in this storm and this far on the edge of no where. The Riftlands are a region where giant rock spires of land jutting out from the sea keep wanderers from moving too fast and make it difficult to hunt, gather, mine and build. That's why so many don't make it out here. The beasts are vicious, but a being can live free. At least that's what Gryp and Fromm thought.  
"I thought I spooked you Gryp", Fromm said.  
"Nigh lad, it takes more than a tow-headed boy to get a rise out of me" Gryp said.  
"It's true, there's not many beast or being out in this kind of weather, we are alone." Fromm said.  
All the men could see of each other was their hoods, the bristle of their beards jutting out, and the gleam of their eyes from the torch. Gryp's steel-gray eyes, were like a hawk's eyes, able to see across many rifts and terrams. This gift made him a valuable asset to his clan.  
Fromm, being younger than Gryp, though a talented hunter, had no such supernatural gift. He learned all he could from his mentor.  
"I think we've scouted this frontier long enough for tonight lad" Gryp said. "We should set up camp in one of the caves we passed a few jogs back"  
Fromm nodded and agreed with his eyes when Gryp looked back at him.  
Just as Gryp turned back the ground gave way beneath both the men. The whole terram seemed to be collapsing under their feet.  
"Hang on lad" Gryp cried out, as he tried to use his axe to latch onto any piece of stable terram; but all his experience in these volatile lands didn't save them tonight. Down they went.  
They only slid down with the rubble for a few meters this time, which was unusual. If it was truly a whole terram collapsing, or  a new rift forming, it would have been much deeper and the wanderers would surely have met the gods this night. The thick garments saved them from a lot of the bruising fall, so they were only slightly rattled. Both were on their feet within seconds shaking off the disorientation.  
It was Fromm that first noticed it, as Gryp was looking the opposite way. Through the blistering snow fall a glow of many lights was ahead.  
"What in the gods name", Gryp mumbled when he saw it too.  
For a few split seconds, both men thought it was some magical monster from the deep rift come to swallow them whole, but this huge glowing beast, was a structure. Fromm already had his axe at his ready.  
"A structure this far out on the frontier Gryp?", Fromm said.  
"I'm as bewildered as you lad", Gryp said. "It could be a missionary outpost".  
Gryp knew this wasn't true. Missionaries didn't make it out this far, and if they did, they would be slaughtered by the local beasts, as it sadly and usually happens; and they wouldn’t build such an ostentatious thing anyway.  
"Perhaps the gods built it themselves", Fromm said back.  
Both kept their voices down since they didn't know what to expect as a threat. Both were hopeful it was some celestial structure with no intentions of harm. This far away from the Central Kingdoms, men were allowed to believe in superstitions.   
There was a noise coming from the direction of the structure, though it was muffled by the winds; a humming. Some of the many lights were moving. Bouncing?  
The yellow lights were then distinguishable as pairs.  
"Run\!", Gryp said a little louder than a whisper.  
Fromm had just thought the same thing and both turned and trampled through the snow, but only a few meters behind them was the rock that had just crumbled underneath their feet, making a wall that slowed them down. They tried to climb, but by then the lights that were pairs of eyes, with bodies attached to them were right behind them.  
Gryp and Fromm turned around and Gryp took down his hood and said, "Good evening mates\!", as he smiled at the beings. The new beings, 8 of them all with goggles that were lit up and long pikes made of steel, not only outnumbered the wanderers, but had tech that baffled the frontiersmen. Gryp knew fighting was not their way out this time.  
"Lovely night for mining", Gryp said keeping his toothy grin. "Care to join us?"  
"Noto\!" said the lead soldier.  
"Noto?" Gryp thought. He knew that was lingo from the monks from the Central Kingdoms of Deluvia. It was impossible for anybody from the Central Kingdoms to be out this far west.  
"Come with us", said the lead soldier.  
One of the soldiers banded the wanderers hands and led them back to the structure.  
As they all treaded through the snow, Gryp moved his eyes without moving his head to look at the garb of these soldiers. His best guess is that they were natives to this land. They had iron-plated pieces; shoulder and chest armor. Covering their armor were strips of white and gray shrouds. They too had hoods but also very strange looking goggles that lit up, which is what they noticed first from a hundred meters away. The goggles, were no doubt to help them see in this kind of weather out here on the fringe. They had boots, but of a different kind of beast fur; something silver in color. A ranscreet, Gryp guessed. Though his beast lore knowledge was the best of his clan, that fur kept him guessing.  
When they got closer to the structure, again without moving his head much, but only his eyes, Gryp began to see what they were headed towards. This was no religious structure, unless their god was a god of miners and industry. "This was a huge mine\!" he thought.  
They crossed over a long iron bridge and down below was the deepest rift he had ever seen; but along the edges were glints of light and ladders, bridges and miners all the way down. Above and ahead of them were huge wind sails, to catch the wind and power the structure. The structure was massive with the central, cylindrical core rotating slowly as the wind sail above it rotated in the opposite direction. Technology Gryp knew nothing about.  
The central structure had six sides and each floor got a little smaller, each had it's own decks and roofs. It was a mix of iron, stone and wood. Some floors had sails coming out and then on top was the large pole, 10 meters high, with three rectilinear sails coming out, collecting the strong winds. The low drum of the sails turning got louder as they approached. Smoke poured from a dozen chimneys scattered throughout the other buildings in the distance. All this was perched on a terram like an island in the air.  
Before they got to the end of the bridge Gryp was finally able to see another strange piece of equipment. It reached over the wide, deep rift with wheels and pulleys letting down platforms and pulling up ore. The scale of it all was more than Gryp could comprehend. It is as if this equipment could reach down and grab ore and pull it up in huge amounts.  
He didn't get much time to study it before they were in the huge, rusted iron doors and were being pushed down a narrow hallway down one side of the building. The soldiers used their pikes to shove the two prisoners into some rusty cells. The barred doors clanked shut and Gryp and Fromm were alone.

# The Azerthoth Kings

He took off his cloak and came slowly forward. He could feel the cold of the large quarried stones, which made up the floor, through his boots.  With his black garb made of Gezereen twiidel, he stood and  felt regal in the cold hallway with portrait busts of the ancestors of the Azerthoth family kings which his family had been subject to for eons.  
The busts, all on plinths of varying heights, all covered in dust, unseemly for their stature were a reminder of the Pallamost rule. Only slivers of light could come into the hall through the narrow windows which highlighted the floating bits of dust and allowe him to see his breath.  
He looked down at one bust and blew the dust off the bald head made of marble and looked at the rugged face for which the Azerthoth kings were known. With all the folds of marble to mimic the wrinkles of skin, he wondered why the artists didn't capture the likeness at a more flattering age. The lifeless eyes, without pupils or irises didn't show power or leadership. Only the fact that they had a bust in the long line of busts in this hallway indicated that they were once important.  
He tried to look into the eyes and wondered if this is the one that killed his grandfather, a loyal subject. He grabbed the head with one hand on each side and pressed his thumbs into where the hard eyes were. He felt as if it was trying to tap into the mind of that ancient king to get a secret and a story. He pressed hard even though he knew he could never penetrate the marble with this thumbs.  
The Castle Pallamost has served the Azerthoth family for 80 generations and to him the whole place felt haunted. He tried to imagine happier times that once occurred in this castle, but with the cold set in and the recent sickness of the king. The neglected dust and moaning creeks of stone crushing on cold stone gave all the more creep to this place.  
Ayrchek came as minister plenipotentiary, back from a mission to Druvenrog; an honor for him, since his family were considered enemies only three generations ago. He came to give the ailing king news from his mission, news that wasn't all good.  
A door opened and a man half hunched over with charcoal robes and a staff to support his frailty, hobbled out.  
"Ayrchek . Good timing son. The king has been waiting your news for weeks. Your trip was eventless." said the older man.  
"Not entirely Golgot." Ayrchek said.  
"Well you look well and safe, and that's what matters right now", Golgot said.  
Golgot took Ayrcheck down a secret hall passed a few armed guard; they went down some stairs and came to a large room that Ayrcheck knew well.  
From the door on the other side of the room, two more robed figures came in, one purple and other red. They were the advisers to the King's court.  
"Your ship wasn't noticed by anyone was it Ayrcheck?", the adviser in red said.  
"It wasn't a secret mission, I don't see why that matters", the adviser in purple said.  
"Well I was more concerned about the zealots in the city thinking we are conspiring with or against Druvenrog" said the adviser in red.  
Ayrcheck took his time in answering as he wanted to avoid giving the wrong response.  
"Good to see you too Wenzel and Collier", Ayrcheck said.  
Wenzel, the one in red, half scoffed, half chuckled, and Collier, the one in purple, bowed and said "Well, it is good to see you too Master Ayrcheck".  
Golgot bowed and said, "I must go fetch Princess Franday, and then we can convene."  
Princess Franday was the last heir to the Azerthoth empire, as the three sons were all slain in battle against the demons in the last war. Though New Pallamost and their allies had rebuilt, much had also been lost.  
The three left in the room looked at each other. Ayrcheck knew the advisers wanted to ask more, but that they should wait. He knew that they were jealous of his new responsibilities. Wenzel and Collier had served the kingdom for 50 years and had been loyal and wise the whole time. They were the two advisers out of the six that were suspicious of Druvenrog, so they had devised this mission to start diplomatic relations with them. Their intentions were not so diplomatic however. They also wanted to keep an eye on the secretive government at Druvenrog.  
Since the king was ill, his daughter Franday represented a stake in this mission as well. Ayrcheck was given full authority by the king, though, so Franday was only there as an adviser as well.  
After awkward glances and small talk between Ayrcheck and the two robed advisors, Golgot was finally back with Franday. When she got into the room she was ran up to Ayrcheck and gave him a hug. She was only 15 and looked up to Ayrcheck like an older brother. All in the room were happy that Ayrcheck was safe.  
The Druvenrog’s were starting to get the reputation of being untrustworthy and vile and the surrounding kingdoms are beginning to get unnerved by it. The assembly of advisers, Golgot, Franday, Wenzel and Collier were all worried about Ayrcheck and his team.  
"We can begin" said Franday as she sat down at the wood table. They were in the war room, which was small, just enough room for 20 people at the most. A large fireplace was on one side, thankfully lit. A large table in the middle, which was rugged with deep grooves from the grain being long worn away, and chairs and benches along it. Candles were on the table and had been burning for a long while.  
They all sat and Ayrcheck began to speak. "It's been many years since we all have been to Druvenrog. They fought along with us against the demons during the Wars and were good allies. But things have changed. There once small cities have grown into a conurbation of vast proportions. Not only are their factories numerous and large, but the tech there is like nothing I have ever seen. The machines of war they are building and amassing makes me feel very leery. They had saved us many times during the Wars with their airships and tech, but they have continued building since, as if preparing for another war"  
"Wait and hold on a minute", said Wenzel. "How are they paying for this? New Pallamost's coffers have been running low for decades, so how do *they* find the coin?"  
"I cannot be certain about all of it", said Ayrcheck, "but a lot of it comes from their intense mining. They weren't at all shy about showing me their vast mines, in fact the whole of Northtop mountain is hollowed out."  
All at the table gasped a little bit, but Collier called out, "What is this\!? How can this be? That would take centuries to dig out."  
Ayrcheck continued, "That surprised me too. They seemed very eager to show off everything to me, but still, I knew there was something they weren't telling me. There were parts of the mountain, that were off limits."  
Franday now spoke. "This might seem alarming to us now, but it could mean nothing. They have simply made much progress and have innovated. Maybe we're all just a bit jealous that our kingdom has seen some hard times lately."  
Golgon hung his head from that sentiment. He had been the king's children's tutor and been affected by Franday’s  brother's death more than most.  
"We were once great, and we still are\!", exclaimed Collier. "We have our castle, citadel, the cathedral and our ships."  
"It's true", said Ayrcheck. "Our pallatial guard is second to no one and nothing I've seen there compares with them."  
"But I want to remain objective and just provide this warning to all of us"  
"And that is why I worry about the zealots", said Wenzel. "All their fears are coming true\! I'm afraid they'll act if this information leaks to them. They have their spies too. I know they think they're just looking out for the kingdom, but their patriotism is dangerous."  
"I think we all agree", said Franday. "What would father want Ayrcheck?"  
"I believe he would want us to be cautious", said Ayrcheck. "I think we try to remain allied to Druvenrog and try to learn their true intentions."  
"What is the progress of the new trade route between our two islands? Has construction resumed?", asked Collier.  
"Noto", said Golgon. "It has halted. It was far too ambitious and expensive."  
"I ask, because that was a gesture of peace to connect our two kingdoms and would improve commerce and relations", said Collier.  
All at the table nodded in agreement.

The meeting had then turned to more small talk and some wine was poured.

Golgot said, “Princess? I must retire for the evening, can I escort you back to your chambers”  
Franday replied “No, but thank you for your service tonight Golgot, my trusted friend. I will have Ayrcheck see me safely home. We have much catching up to do\!”  
She looked at Ayrcheck with a gleaming smile.  
Ayrcheck and Franday had grown up together, frolicking in the palace gardens and running through the streets of New Palamost playing games with the other children.  
Things were so carefree back then, but now they both have much responsibility. Franday, being the sole remaining heir to the throne, and Ayrcheck was groomed to be a member of the Court from an early age. Now during these dark times they feel the need to rise up to meet their destiny.  
As the others head out of the war room, Franday and Ayrcheck stay and talk into the thin hours of the night, catching up, retelling childhood stories, but for tonight, anything but the pressing matters of the kingdom. That can wait for tomorrow.

Ardan Talonwing  
In the mystical world of Avia, there existed a race of bird-like beings known as the Aven. Among them, there lived a wizard named Ardran Talonwing, whose feathers shimmered with the hues of twilight and whose eyes held the wisdom of ages past. Ardran was not just a wizard; he was a veteran of the great war waged against the Old Gods, a conflict that reshaped the very fabric of their world.

Born amidst the towering spires of Avia's highest mountains, Ardran grew up hearing tales of the Old Gods who once ruled the skies and the earth with an iron grip. These deities were beings of immense power, ancient and formidable, whose desires often clashed with the harmony of the mortal realm.

As a young Aven, Ardran was imbued with a natural affinity for magic. He trained under the tutelage of the most venerable sorcerers of Avia, honing his skills in the arcane arts while also mastering the ancient lore that spoke of the Old Gods' tyranny.

When the drums of war echoed across the land, Ardran answered the call without hesitation. He joined the ranks of the Aven army, standing shoulder to shoulder with warriors and wizards alike, united in their quest to rid the world of the Old Gods' tyranny once and for all.

The war was fierce and unrelenting, with battles raging across the skies and the earth below. Ardran fought with valor and determination, wielding his magic like a beacon of hope amidst the darkness of despair. He witnessed the horrors of war, the devastation wrought by the Old Gods' wrath, and the sacrifices made by those who dared to defy their rule.

In the crucible of conflict, Ardran emerged as a stalwart defender of Avia, leading his comrades with courage and conviction. He braved the storm of chaos, facing adversaries whose power transcended mortal comprehension, yet never once faltering in his resolve.

It was a long and arduous struggle, but in the end, the Aven prevailed. The Old Gods were vanquished, their dominion shattered, and peace was restored to the land once more. Yet, the scars of war ran deep, etched into the very soul of Avia and its inhabitants.

As the dust settled and the world began to heal, Ardran took solace in the quiet moments of reflection. He found solace in the stories of old, weaving tales of heroism and triumph, of sacrifice and redemption, for those who would listen.

In the twilight of his years, Ardran became a keeper of memories, a guardian of the past, sharing his wisdom with generations yet to come. He regaled young Aven with the legends of the war against the Old Gods, imparting lessons of courage and resilience, reminding them of the price paid for freedom.

And so, beneath the vast expanse of Avia's endless skies, the legacy of Ardran Talonwing endured, a beacon of hope amidst the ever-changing currents of time. For in his stories, the spirit of the Aven lived on, a testament to the enduring power of magic and the indomitable strength of the heart.

The Sage of Twilight:  
Ardran Talonwing, known to some as the Sage of Twilight, is a figure veiled in the soft hues of dusk. His feathers catch the fading light, refracting it into a myriad of colors that dance like whispers on the wind. His eyes, deep pools of ancient wisdom, hold secrets untold, reflecting the depths of a thousand sunsets. To those who seek his counsel, he is a beacon of enlightenment amidst the shadows of uncertainty, his words like threads of starlight weaving through the tapestry of time.

The Whisperer of Arcane Whispers:  
Ardran moves through the realms with a grace that defies mortal comprehension, his form a fleeting silhouette against the backdrop of eternity. In the hallowed halls of forgotten lore, he is known as the Whisperer of Arcane Whispers, a guardian of knowledge obscured by the veils of mystery. His voice, a soft murmur that resonates with the echoes of forgotten spells, carries the weight of centuries past, beckoning those who dare to delve into the depths of the unknown.

The Shadowed Sentinel:  
Among the towering spires of Avia, Ardran stands as a sentinel cloaked in shadows, his presence a testament to the mysteries that lie beyond the realm of mortal understanding. His movements are silent, like whispers in the night, as he navigates the labyrinthine corridors of ancient ruins and lost civilizations. To those who catch a glimpse of his form amidst the darkness, he is a figure shrouded in enigma, his purpose veiled in the veils of secrecy that cloak the world in shadows.

The Veiled Voyager:  
Ardran wanders the windswept plains and mist-shrouded valleys of Avia, a solitary figure lost in the ebb and flow of time. His origins are as elusive as the shifting sands of the desert, his true nature hidden behind a veil of illusion that obscures the boundaries between reality and myth. In the depths of his gaze lies the reflection of a thousand journeys, each one a testament to the endless quest for truth that drives his restless soul. To those who seek to unravel the mysteries of existence, he is a guide through the realms of the unknown, a veiled voyager on a journey without end.

The description of Ardran as bearing marks of forgotten battles etched into his feathers, with each scar telling a story of trials endured and secrets guarded, adds layers of mystery to his character.

Firstly, the idea of "forgotten battles" suggests that Ardran has been involved in conflicts that have faded from the collective memory of the world. These battles could have been of immense significance, involving ancient powers or conflicts lost to time.

The scars etched into his feathers imply that Ardran has faced dangers and challenges beyond ordinary comprehension. Each scar represents a story, a tale of struggle and survival, hinting at the depths of his experiences and the secrets he holds.

Furthermore, the suggestion that his true nature intertwines with the ancient magics of Avia adds another level of intrigue. It implies that Ardran is not just a wizard but perhaps a being of profound significance, connected to the mystical forces that shape the world.

Finally, the mention of forgotten oaths and the veils of mystery suggests that there are aspects of Ardran's past and identity that remain hidden, even from those closest to him. His character becomes a enigma, wrapped in layers of secrecy and intrigue, leaving readers or listeners intrigued and curious to uncover the truths hidden within his tangled history.

Gilderstilt Featherheart

In the vast expanse of Eldoria, amidst its rugged landscapes and towering peaks, thrived the Hawk Clan, a lineage of noble warriors and learned scholars. Among them, there lived Gilderstilt Featherheart, a scribe whose quill danced with the elegance of a soaring hawk, chronicling the sagas of his people and the trials they faced. Gilderstilt was not merely a keeper of lore; he was a veteran of the tumultuous war waged against the Old Gods, a conflict that left indelible marks on his soul and his homeland.

Born beneath the shadow of Eldoria's craggy cliffs, Gilderstilt's early years were steeped in the traditions of the Hawk Clan. From the ancient tomes that lined the shelves of his clan's library, he gleaned knowledge and wisdom beyond his years, his thirst for understanding rivaling his kin's thirst for battle. While others trained in the arts of war, Gilderstilt delved into the annals of history, seeking solace and insight within the pages of forgotten lore.

When the drums of war echoed across Eldoria and the shadows of the Old Gods loomed large, Gilderstilt's heart weighed heavy with the burden of duty. Clad not in armor, but in the robes of a scribe, he marched alongside his brethren, resolved to safeguard the stories of his people amidst the chaos and turmoil that threatened to engulf them.

In the crucible of conflict, Gilderstilt's quill became his sword, his tomes his shield. Amidst the clash of steel and the roar of arcane magics, he traversed the war-torn landscapes, bearing witness to the heroism and sacrifice that defined his clan's struggle against the tyranny of the Old Gods. He chronicled the valor of his comrades, the tragedies of war, and the triumphs of the indomitable spirit that burned bright within the hearts of the Hawk Clan.

As the war drew to a close and the Old Gods were cast down from their thrones, Eldoria underwent a profound transformation. The land that had borne witness to countless battles could no longer sustain the Hawk Clan, and they were forced to embark on a journey of migration, seeking refuge in distant lands.

Among the bustling streets and bustling streets of Bardtown, Gilderstilt found himself in the company of fellow scribes and scholars, drawn together by their shared love of knowledge and learning. In the tranquil halls of Bardtown's libraries, he continued his life's work, transcribing the tales of his people and preserving the legacy of the Hawk Clan for generations to come.

And so, amidst the ever-changing tapestry of time, the legacy of Gilderstilt Featherheart endured, a testament to the resilience of the Hawk Clan and the enduring power of knowledge. Though separated from his ancestral home, his spirit remained unbroken, his quill poised to inscribe the tales of Eldoria's past and the dreams of its future upon the pages of history.
