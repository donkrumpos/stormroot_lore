# THE TWELVE WHO DREAM THE WORLD  
### An Overview of the Deluvic Pantheon

Each of the Twelve is a child of the Primordials—born not through intent,  
but through collision of breath, tide, spark, and shadow.

They represent:
- an **element**  
- a **virtue**  
- a **vice**  
- a **town**  
- a **shadow-dungeon**  
- a **people**  
- a **magic domain**

## Pantheon Dynamics  
- The Twelve rarely agree.  
- Many still blame Khel’Druun for the First Severing.  
- None speak openly after the Second Severing.  
- Their shadow-aspects grow yearly.  

The Twelve still dream the world—  
but the dream is fraying.
