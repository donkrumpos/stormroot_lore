# THE TWELVEFOLD ELEMENTAL WHEEL  
### The Elemental, Moral, and Cosmic Structure of Deluvia

Deluvia is shaped not by four elements, but by **twelve**—  
each a behavior of the world, a personality, a virtue and vice.

## Elemental Philosophy  
Each element is not a substance,  
but a **behavior of the world**.

- Water remembers  
- Fire transforms  
- Soil bears  
- Life grows  
- Death releases  
- Moon reflects  
- Sun reveals  
- Ore resists  
- Poison unveils  
- Storm surges  
- Chaos breaks  
- Wind wanders  

Together they compose the full spectrum of being.

## The Balance Principle  
Each element has:

- a virtue (its healthy form)  
- a vice (its shadow)  
- a shrine (its cultural anchor)  
- a dungeon (its corruption)  

When the Twelve are aligned, the world thrives.  
When any falter, the shadow grows.

The Age of Storms marks a time  
when the Wheel is dangerously out of alignment.
