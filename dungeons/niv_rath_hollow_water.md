# Niv'Rath Hollow — The Pool of Haught  
### Where the Tide Tests the Proud

Niv’Rath Hollow is the Water Severing Dungeon bound to Rothigport.  
Its first reachable layer is called **the Pool of Haught**—  
a lush cavern where a once-noble water elemental now measures the pride of mortals.

---

## Entrance & First Impression

Following the northern coast, north and west of Rothigport, travelers find:

- a secluded **cove** with a **thin waterfall** like a silver thread,  
- a **small cave** hidden behind ferns at the waterfall’s source,  
- descending tunnels that open into a **humid, echoing chamber**:  
  the Pool of Haught.

The pool’s surface reflects not how one *appears*,  
but how one secretly thinks of themself.

Boastful hearts see themselves aggrandized.  
Ashamed hearts see their worst failures.  
Those at peace see something nearer to truth.

## Mistborforl, Tide-Warden in Exile

Mistborforl was once a **Tide-Warden of Nailune**, a spirit entrusted to watch over the ocean’s boundary with the Great Forge—  
where quenched metal met sea-currents.

When the Forge was seized by the technopriests of Druvvenrog  
and **Skragamor, Keeper of Flame**, was cast into the deeper Nether,  
the tide-watches failed.

Mistborforl:

- blames both mortals **and** gods,  
- has grown scornful and vain in his isolation,  
- now rules the Pool of Haught as a **petty judge of humility**.

He is powerful but not fully corrupted—  
still loosely aligned with Nailune’s intent, but distorted by resentment.

**In play**:

- High HP, heavy **waterball** and **geyser** attacks.  
- In dialogue, he mocks mortals’ attempts at “virtue” and “purity”.

## The Shrine of Purity & the Tempest Prophecy

Carved into the cavern wall is the **Shrine of Purity**, an ancient altar of Nailune now stained with salt deposits.

Etched maxims include a riddle:

> “West of the City of Wood  
>  rests a pond that could  
>  a mortal dive and swim  
>  and arrive to find him in a cavern lush—  
>  the Guardian of scornful gush.”

And a hidden invocation:

> “Mine enemies be scorched by the lightning  
>  and tossed by the Tempest.  
>  May the pure be spared from the Storm.”

**Mechanics hook:**

- By **offering to the Shrine** (acts of humility, restitution, or sacrifice),  
  players can:
  - reduce Mistborforl’s aggression,  
  - unlock secret passages or platforms,  
  - and flag themselves for future **“Storm-Sparing”** events (Rothigport may later be spared a divine tempest if enough offerings have been made).

This shrine is also one node in a larger **Virtues Quest** network.

## The Great Unstitching & Mortal Ignorance

Surface mortals only notice Niv’Rath’s disturbance when:

- the **fishing industry declines**,  
- nets come up light or with twisted, translucent fish,  
- coastal currents shift strangely.

**Rosage, the Potion Maker**, is the first to truly question it.  
Rosage:

- consults the **Oracle at Omphalos**,  
- learns that Deluvia is **rerouting ley lines** in something called the **Great Unstitching / Severing**,  
- gains the attention of **Nax Hollum**, who takes Rosage as apprentice.

None of them yet know that:

- Mistborforl’s exile,  
- Skragamor’s defeat at the Great Forge,  
- and Rothigport’s blooming pride

are all threads in the same tear.

## The Test of the Pool

The Pool of Haught doesn’t just host a boss fight. It **judges**:

- Players who arrive boasting, demanding, or mocking the rites  
  → face full wrath, stronger spells, and no quarter.  
- Players who arrive after acts of humility (helping beggars, aiding fishermen, serving without boasting)  
  → find the water quieter, with possible dialogue paths to **bargain** instead of fight.

Mistborforl can:

- reluctantly admit he is also proud,  
- acknowledge Nailune’s intent,  
- and either:
  - grant a **blessing of spared storm** for Rothigport,  
  - teach a **water spell**,  
  - or open access to a **lower layer** of Niv’Rath Hollow.

---

## Symbolic Role

The Pool of Haught sits at the crossroads of:

- Nailune’s **humility** vs Mistborforl’s **hurt pride**,  
- Rothigport’s founding pragmatism vs creeping vanity,  
- the **industrial arrogance** of Druvvenrog and its technopriests.

It is less a boss arena and more a **moral pressure point**:  
if enough mortals approach it humbly,  
Deluvia may rewrite the storm that’s coming.
