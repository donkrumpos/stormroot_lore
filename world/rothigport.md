# Rothigport, City That Never Sank

Rothigport is a city built on tides and rumor.

It does not sit on an island so much as *hover* beside one—a wide ring of docks, barges, and raft-islands lashed together in the shelter of **Goylsmuth Bay**, creaking gently with every swell. Lanterns sway over black water, gulls circle the fish-guts slick at dawn, and somewhere in the fog a tide-bard is always singing under their breath.

To sailors and traders it is the **major market of northern Songtide**, the place where everything eventually floats in. To the rest of Deluvia it is a story:  
the **City That Never Sank**, the town that rode out the Great Deluge by simply rising with the water.

## Elemental Character

Rothigport is firmly seated in **Water**, with a soft halo of **Moon**.

- **Water**: memory, trade-currents, emotional tides.  
  - The city remembers every ship and every storm; old deals and old grudges never quite wash away.
- **Moon**: mist, secrets, half-seen magic.  
  - Fog rolls in thick as wool, hiding smuggler lights and quiet spellwork.  
  - Bards swear the moons themselves tug the harbor like a heartstring.

In the world’s elemental ledger, Rothigport reads as:

- **Primary vector**: Water ↑ (Memory & Tides)  
- **Secondary vector**: Moon ↑ (Illusion & Thresholds)  
- **Shadow**: Fire ↯ (distant threat of transformation, war, and Deluge returning)

## Origins & the Deluge

Five centuries ago, when the mainland kingdoms around Songtide were still busy stabbing each other, a handful of fishers decided the safest place to live was **offshore**.

They drove timber piles into the shallows, moored retired hulls together, and nailed shacks to the decks. Every good season added another boat, another shed, another plank-bridge. What began as a **hook-dealers’ dock** became a sprawled raft-village, then—slowly—Rothigport.

- **Water as Wall** – Early founders treated the bay as both moat and highway. Raiders could not easily march to a town that floated.
- **The City That Never Sank** – When the **Great Deluge** came, coastal towns drowned or slid into the sea. Rothigport’s buildings simply rose with the water, anchored to their piles and barges. The bay’s curve broke the worst of the storm. The legend stuck.

In the cultural memory of Songtide, Rothigport is proof that yielding can be stronger than resisting: a city that bent and bobbed and survived.

## Layout & Districts

Rothigport is a layered spiral of damp wood and hanging light.

### The Floating Ring

At its heart is a **ring of platforms and house-barges** surrounding a calmer inner lagoon:

- **Inner Lagoon** – Ships crowd here during storms, tying directly to the city itself. This is also where the **Harbor Shouting**—Rothigport’s election ritual—takes place.
- **Outer Ring** – Warehouses, crane-towers, net-drying racks, and taverns that lean over black water.

A rough divide runs through the city:

- **Eastside** – Denser and richer: guildhalls, merchant houses, the Duke’s banners, and the more respectable taverns.
- **Westside** – Broader and poorer: fish markets, shrines, ramshackle tenements, and the loudest tide-songs.

### Blackthorn Bridge & Modrik’s Causeway

Two great spans define the town’s silhouette:

- **Blackthorn Bridge** – A sweeping wood-and-iron bridge on the southern harbor, built by the **Blackthorn brothers** to link east and west. For dockfolk it is a symbol that the city belongs to everyone, not just the rich.

- **Modrik’s Causeway** – A newer stone-and-timber causeway that reaches from the western ring to the larger island of **Noctisbard**. It is half-celebrated, half-resisted: walking to the islands feels a little like inviting the mainland’s problems to walk back.

### Beneath the Planks

Under Rothigport is another town entirely:

- **Piling-Forest** – A maze of barnacled posts, chains, and shuddering crossbeams where smugglers, waterfolk, and strange barnacle-shrines cling to the wet dark.
- **Waterfolk Warrens** – Flooded chambers and half-submerged markets where the **Prismarese** and **Gillaquid** trade pearls, relics, and rumors that never touch the upper docks.

---

## People & Races

For a town of barely **seven or eight hundred residents**, Rothigport feels crowded. Boats arrive daily with strangers who stay a night, a season, or a lifetime.

Common peoples include:

- **Anthoran** – A broad majority; farmers’ grandchildren and merchants’ cousins who followed the fishing trade north.
- **Formori & Nemedi exiles** – Hard-faced refugees from **Druvenrog**, bringing industrial skills and old grudges.
- **Halflings** – Warehouse-keepers and ledger-minders with a talent for knowing exactly what came off which ship.
- **Orsi** – Deep-chested brewers and stewards of **Orsinowl Ale**, treated as both drink and sacrament.
- **Miliposi** – Small, blue-skinned traders with nimble hands and sharper eyes, clustered in colorful stilt-houses.
- **Prismarese & Gillaquid** – Amphibious or fully aquatic folk, surfacing in potion-masks to haggle in dripping courtyards.
- **Swigtooth** – Hoofed, muddy, sharp-witted bargainers perfectly at home in the moral gray water between “fee” and “bribe.”
- **Kapasian Elves** – Sea-romantics who walked away from strictly astral courts to chase storms and song.

Rothigport’s people joke that the census is pointless: the city is different every tide.

## Government & Power

### The Harbor Shouting

Rothigport does not have hereditary lords. It has **Dukes chosen by volume**.

When a new Duke must be chosen:

1. Candidates stand in separate boats in the inner lagoon.  
2. Citizens crowd the surrounding docks.  
3. Names are shouted, argued, chanted, and sung.  
4. When one name overwhelms the rest—one roar, one rhythm—that person becomes **Duke for life**.

The current Duke, **Percimor** of yellow-and-black **House Percimor**, is more steward than visionary: cautious, fair enough, and constantly trying to keep the guilds from tearing the city in half.

### The Five Guild Syndics

Real power is braided through **five great guilds**, each led by a **Syndic**:

1. **Lumberjacks’ Guild** – Oldest and most honored. Their early foresting built the town itself. They fiercely defend the tradition that Rothigport is a *wooden* city, not a stone one.

2. **Shipbuilders’ Guild** – Represents the rival houses **Heneesri** (many small vessels) and **Lordiyan** (few massive hulls). Their yards dominate long stretches of dock.

3. **Fishermen’s Guild** – Guardians of quotas, tariffs, and the quiet politics of who is allowed to fish which waters. Many elites hold honorary membership.

4. **Bards’ Guild** – Tidemasters who blend song, weather-sense, and subtle magic. They select and train the official harbor-bards whose voices guide ships through fog and calm raging swells.

5. **Arcanists’ Guild** – A discreet network helping hedge-mages, apprentices, and quiet sorcerers survive in a world where the **Central Kingdoms** insist magic is dead. The guild keeps its sigils small and its doors unmarked.

### Merchant Princes & Street Factions

- **Merkti Prigtoon** of emerald-and-gold **House Ketapesh**  
  Wealthiest merchant in the city and Syndic of the Fishermen’s Guild. He dreams of tolls, proper taxes, and “civilized” order—the kind where his ledgers always win.

- **Thod & Igmo Blackthorn** of **House Blackthorn** (black and red)  
  Brothers who clawed their way up from dock-orphans to shipping magnates. Their district, jokingly called **Blackthornberg**, is wealthy but rough. They are beloved by the working classes and quietly feared by old money.

- **Anti-Tollers**  
  A loose coalition of dockhands, shrine-keepers, tide-bards, and small traders resisting Prigtoon’s push to put a toll on Blackthorn Bridge. To them, tolls on the *symbol of unity* are sacrilege.

Beneath these are dozens of lodges, cults, and crews: the **Greenmen’s Lodge**, **Dockstayers’ Lodge**, bardic clans from **Bardstown**, pirate-friendly merchant circles like **Parmite**, and more.

## Magic, Moonlight, and the Rot

Songtide is a haven for magic precisely because it pretends not to be.

- **Public Face**  
  Officially, Rothigport is a pious, practical trade-town. Magic is a story from the old days; wizards are “eccentric scholars” in towers far from town.

- **Private Reality**  
  Tide-bards lean on songspells to read currents and winds. Orsi brewers lace rituals into their ales. Quiet mages keep wards on the pilings. The **Arcanists’ Guild** arranges apprenticeships far from the eyes of Central Kingdom envoys.

- **The Rot**  
  A flesh-eating plague whispered to be **death-magic from Wraithwood**, north of the Valley of the Moon.  
  - Its creeping edge, the **Rotted Reach**, inches northward each year.  
  - The first lumberjacks to carry it home came from **Hawk Finster Hollow**.  
  - Rothigport has only seen a handful of cases, all hush-hushed and quarantined. Everyone knows the name, few speak it aloud.

Behind many of these stories lurks the pale rumor of **Necromensus** and his expanding cult of bone and Rot. Shrines to him are illegal but not rare.

## Notable Figures

- **Duke Percimor** – Elected steward of Rothigport and Goylsmuth. Tries to keep trade flowing and guild knives sheathed.

- **Merkti Prigtoon** – Richest man in town; a smiling knife in fine green cloth.

- **Majordomo Ventroth** – Prigtoon’s cleric and fixer, bearing holy titles and unholy ledgers.

- **Thod & Igmo Blackthorn** – Bridge-builders, smugglers, and folk-heroes in the making.

- **Guyhain** – A reclusive archmage in a tower beyond the islands, shy but kind when approached with respect.

- **Derrod** – Another archmage, quietly gathering allies against any future Inquisition.

- **Bufurmont** – Overzealous reeve of the market, tasked with “keeping weapons out.” Often ignored, occasionally dangerous.

- **Quinn** – Bartender at **The Rusty Anchor**, where stories ferment.

- **Picaroo** – A charming pirate whose tales are half lies, half adventure hooks.

- **Lathander** – Self-styled “professional greeter” outside the joint Townhall/Fishermen’s Guildhall, an ideal lore-dump for newcomers.

## Story Seeds

These are the quest structures woven most tightly into Rothigport’s identity. You can expand any of them into full dungeons or campaigns.

### 1. Phanasma’s Vanishing

Merkti Prigtoon once had a daughter: **Phanasma**.

- Brilliant, stubborn, and mage-touched, she defied her father’s mercantile ambitions and spent her days among young wizards and bardic halls.
- She contracted **The Rot**. In panic and shame, Merkti quarantined her and her loyal guard **Kervan** on a tiny isle near Rothigport.
- One night she vanished. Officially: dead and interred with rich grave-goods in the **Ketapesh Mausoleum**. Unofficially: the coffin felt too light.

Hooks:

- Rumors of treasure buried with Phanasma draw adventurers to the mausoleum.  
- Inside, **twelve named crypts** (Katrina Ulvid, the Cursed Twins, Kervan, Panza, the Orins, and others) each hold:
  - a small relic,
  - a short riddle or epitaph,
  - and an **Unburied** echo that must be defeated or appeased.

Each soul laid to rest brings clearer visions of what happened to Phanasma—and whispers of something deeper below.

### 2. The Bone Church of Ossidarius

Old stories frighten Songtide children with a place called the **Bone Church**: a cathedral carved from bone and skull, somewhere beneath the crypts.

Truth:

- The mausoleum’s deepest stair was long ago collapsed, sealing the work of an architect called **Sedladus** who went mad trying to design the perfect ossuary for the bone-god **Ossidarius**.
- Sedladus died trapped below, scratching final designs into stone with bloody fingers. His half-finished cathedral has since become home to the **Keepers of the Book of Bones**.

Hooks:

- The Keepers seek an architect—or a mage—capable of finishing Sedladus’ design and fully opening a conduit to Ossidarius.  
- Their **Book of Bones** may hold a cure for the Rot, or a way to refine it into a weapon.  
- Sedladus’ restless corpse still paces the antechamber, muttering design notes that are half-geometry, half prayer.

### 3. Bridge Wars

Prigtoon wants a **toll** on Blackthorn Bridge “to fund harbor maintenance.” The **Anti-Tollers** call it a first step toward strangling the poor.

Hooks:

- PCs can be courted by both sides to sabotage, sway opinion, or perform miraculous acts (legal or magical) during debates on the fog-choked bridge.  
- The conflict can crescendo during the next **Harbor Shouting**, where the city chooses whether it wants more Percimor, a Prigtoon-backed candidate… or a Blackthorn revolution.
