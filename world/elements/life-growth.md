# Mythic Introduction
Life is **the warm surge beneath the bark**,  
the swelling bud that dares itself into blossom,  
the brave green push breaking through old soil.

It is not simply existence —  
it is **becoming**, again and again.

Where Soil teaches patience and burden,  
and Sun reveals clarity,  
Life teaches **expansion**:  
the courage to spread, root, reach, heal, and multiply.

Life is the spiral hidden in seeds —  
an ancient blueprint the world continuously rereads.  
Every forest, creature, fungus, and breath is a verse of this eternal script.

To follow Life is to believe that growth is holy,  
even when growth takes strange or unexpected shapes.

# Narrative Domain: Growth
Life governs stories about:
- healing wounds  
- communities flourishing  
- creatures evolving  
- transformations through nurture  
- symbiotic relationships  
- things blooming when given space  
- the return of vitality after ruin  

Life stories tend to:
- begin small  
- accumulate warmth, characters, and stakes  
- resolve in restoration rather than conquest  
- center interdependence  

When dominant in a narrative:
- NPCs form alliances  
- towns begin cooperative projects  
- creatures migrate or multiply  
- dormant shrines awaken  
- overgrowth becomes a subtle puzzle element  

When corrupted:
- vines choke paths  
- beasts multiply too rapidly  
- fungal blooms override ecosystems  
- “help” becomes smothering  

Life asks:  
**“What wants to grow here, and why?”**

# Town Alignment: Greenhallow (Virtue: Compassion)
Greenhallow is built around colossal ancient trees whose roots form natural bridges and platforms. Moss-lit lanterns glow with bioluminescent spores; gentle beasts wander through the streets like welcomed neighbors.

Its people:
- practice herbal arts and healing rites  
- hold festivals celebrating each new sprout or hatchling  
- treat animals as kin  
- believe every problem has a nurturing solution  

When Life influence rises:
- new plant species appear overnight  
- domesticated beasts gain curious intelligence  
- fruit harvests overflow  
- children have vivid dreams of “root-teachers”  
- sick NPCs recover unexpectedly fast  

When corruption (Overgrowth) rises:
- invasive vines creep through doorways  
- fungus blooms render paths impassable  
- over-symbiosis: creatures merging with plants  
- healers become *too* protective, resisting change  

Greenhallow proverb:  
**“If something grows wild, listen before you cut.”**

# Dungeon Alignment: Thornspire (Growth Distorted)
Thornspire is a towering vertical jungle-dungeon, spiraling like a colossal vine.  
Rooms shift as roots burrow, flowers open, and branches unfurl.

The dungeon is alive — constantly.

It manifests:
- shifting vine bridges  
- pollen mists that alter player stats  
- carnivorous plants with surprising intelligence  
- symbiotic creatures guarding heartwood chambers  

Mutations when growth is strong:
- new passages form  
- healing fruit nodes appear  
- roots reshape corridors  
- plant-beasts evolve mid-combat  
- mini-bosses molt into new forms  

Corruption (Overgrowth):
- thorn-maws that consume loot  
- choke-vines that trap entire rooms  
- spore storms that spread confusion  
- mycelial networks that overwrite corridors  
- bosses that regenerate endlessly unless the environment is balanced  

Thornspire’s test is simple:  
**Can you navigate a world that insists on growing faster than you move?**

# Deity Alignment: Myrathe, the Verdant Pulse
**Titles:**  
- The Rootmother  
- Greenheart Sovereign  
- She Who Sprouts the World  
- Keeper of the Living Spiral  

Myrathe appears as a towering figure composed of woven bark, vine, and flower — constantly blooming and shedding, blooming and shedding again.

She teaches:
- compassion  
- interdependence  
- healing through touch or presence  
- the dignity of tiny beginnings  

She discourages:
- neglect  
- careless destruction  
- selfish isolation  
- hoarding of natural gifts  

Signs of her attention:
- a sprout emerging from a player’s footprint  
- a creature calmly approaching instead of fleeing  
- petals falling in still air  
- sudden warmth in the soil  

Myrathe’s blessings:
- accelerated regeneration  
- fertility and abundance  
- loyal beast companions  
- immunity to natural toxins  

She is the heartbeat that never learned to stop.

# Environmental Effects (Procedural Hooks)
Life influence causes:
- increased wildlife encounters (friendly or curious)  
- fast-growing plants that reshape navigation  
- healing herbs spawning commonly  
- temporary “growth blessings” on players  

Narrative shifts:
- quests emphasize nurturing, restoration, diplomacy  
- NPCs form bonds or “care arcs”  
- towns rebuild or expand  
- dungeons generate regenerative hazards or helpers  

Corruption effects:
- mobs multiply exponentially  
- plants impede sightlines or movement  
- supporting one system harms another (ecosystem imbalance)  
- fungal infections spread across towns

# NPC Archetypes (System-Usable)
Life-aligned NPCs:
- herbalists  
- beast-keepers  
- fungal sages  
- heartwood guardians  
- sprout-singers  
- wandering healers  

Traits:
- gentle eyes  
- hands always busy caring for something  
- slow to anger, quick to help  
- often accompanied by small creatures or spores  
- smell faintly of flowers or soil  

Common greeting in Greenhallow:  
**“May your roots find water.”**

---

# Quest Seeds (Procedural-Ready)
1. **The Overblossomed Orchard**  
   Fruit trees bear too much — causing ecological imbalance.

2. **The Creature That Grew Too Fast**  
   A beloved village pet transforms into a towering guardian overnight.

3. **The Garden That Remembers**  
   A ritual garden begins reenacting old traumas through sentient vines.

4. **The Heartwood Bloom**  
   A sacred tree blooms out of season, calling adventurers inward.

# Shrine Behavior
Shrines to Life:
- emit warmth  
- sprout small green shoots when approached  
- heal minor wounds  
- glow faintly when compassion is shown  
- accept offerings of seeds, water, nurturing acts  

Corruption symptoms:
- overgrowth smothers altars  
- healing becomes invasive (vines binding too tightly)  
- offerings vanish into hungry roots  
- spores cause hallucinations of “infinite gardens”
