# Mythic Introduction
Moon is not darkness —  
it is **the soft light that asks questions daylight is too proud to ask**.

It reveals by obscuring,  
clarifies by confusing,  
and teaches by leading wanderers through dreams  
where truth wears a thousand comfortable masks.

Illusion, in the lunar sense, is not deception.  
It is *possibility* — the shimmering awareness  
that the world is stranger, wider, and more permeable than mortals pretend.

Moon is the **inner night**, the whisper of  
“this too might be true,”  
a teacher of intuition and the hidden paths between waking and dreaming.

Where Sun is revelation, Moon is **revelation-without-demand**:  
a gentle unravelling of certainty.

# Narrative Domain: Illusion
Moon governs:
- dreams and subconscious memory  
- lost or half-remembered truths  
- disguises that reveal more than they hide  
- uncanny encounters  
- liminal spaces where nothing fully resolves  

It influences:
- characters who second-guess or question meaning  
- scenes where reality feels thin  
- quests involving divination, prophecy, or waking visions  

Moon stories often:
- begin in confusion  
- deepen into introspection  
- resolve with a whisper of clarity rather than a shout

Illusion is not trickery —  
it is the **space between what is and what might be**.

# Town Alignment: Moondrift (Virtue: Insight)
Moondrift sits on an elevated plateau of pale stone,  
a place where moonlight lingers even at midday.  
Fog rolls through its alleys like sleepwalking animals,  
and lanterns burn with silver-wicked flame.

People of Moondrift:
- speak softly, but with layers of meaning  
- keep journals of their dreams and compare them during festivals  
- trust intuition as much as logic  
- consider “what the moon showed me” a legitimate argument  

When Moon dominates Moondrift:
- reflections behave independently  
- cats gather at crossroads as if expecting someone  
- children speak in prophetic riddles  
- lanterns brighten when someone tells the truth  
- strange footprints appear on rooftops at dawn  

Moondrift is a town where  
**the unseen is always just slightly seen**.

# Dungeon Alignment: Gloamsorrow (Illusion Manifest)
Gloamsorrow is the dungeon where **light doubts itself**.

Formed where a tear in the Night Weave slipped too close to mortal soil,  
it is a labyrinth of reflective halls,  
moonlit chambers, and corridors that rearrange based on memory.

Gloamsorrow is known for:
- rooms that replay past choices  
- illusions that expose deeper truths rather than mislead  
- puzzles requiring intuition over logic  
- enemies that flicker between forms based on fear  
- echoes that sometimes answer differently than the speaker  

Dungeon mutations under high Moon influence:
- walls become semi-transparent, showing “possible” rooms  
- illusions become literal paths  
- bosses gain dreamlike attack patterns  
- forgotten or suppressed memories manifest as enemies  

Gloamsorrow does not try to kill intruders.  
It tries to **wake them**.

# Deity Alignment: Nailune, Weaver of Veils
**Titles:**  
- Lady of the Second Reflection  
- The Silver-Bound Lantern  
- Dream-Thread Weaver  
- She Who Knows the True Name of Shadows  

Nailune appears as a tall, serene figure  
with a mask that shifts expressions when unobserved,  
her cloak a tapestry of incomplete dreams.

She teaches:
- introspection  
- humility before the unknown  
- the value of uncertainty  
- that insight is born from patience, not force  

She dislikes:
- those who demand certainty  
- truths spoken carelessly  
- illusions used for cruelty  

Signs of her attention:
- a faint second shadow  
- candles extinguishing at meaningful moments  
- hearing your name spoken softly from behind  
- ripples in still water despite no disturbance  

Her guidance arrives as:
- riddles  
- dreams  
- half-remembered songs  
- calm in the moments before despair

# Environmental Effects (Procedural Hooks)
When Moon influences a region:
- paths shift subtly overnight  
- rumors become unusually accurate  
- forgotten lore surfaces  
- illusions manifest physically  
- animals behave as if they see invisible things  

Moon amplifies:
- secrets  
- hunches  
- symbolic events  
- prophetic dreams  
- uncanny coincidences  

It weakens:
- rigid logic  
- structured routines  
- brute-force approaches

# NPC Archetypes (System-Usable)
Moon-aligned NPCs:
- dream-scribes  
- illusionists  
- crescent monks  
- mask-makers  
- wandering soothsayers  
- night archivists  

Personality traits:
- indirect speech  
- a tendency toward metaphor  
- unsettling calm  
- patient listening  
- reverence for dreams  

Common Moondrift saying:  
**“Truth waits where shadows meet.”**

# Quest Seeds (Procedural-Ready)
1. **The Lantern That Follows**  
   A glowing lantern begins accompanying a villager, illuminating their hidden regrets.

2. **Dreams That Spill Into Streets**  
   Fog thickens and starts whispering dreams aloud; players must discern whose dreams they are.

3. **The Mask That Tells the Truth**  
   A ceremonial mask refuses to come off once worn — until the wearer speaks the truth they’ve avoided.

4. **The Forgotten Door**  
   A new door appears between two houses each night but leads somewhere different each time.

# Shrine Behavior
Shrines to Moon manifest understated but eerie phenomena:
- offerings disappear with no sound  
- moonlight pools unnaturally even indoors  
- reflections show symbolic rather than literal images  
- incense smoke curls into words before dissipating  

Corruption symptoms (Delusion):
- reflections argue with their owners  
- illusions persist too long  
- mental fog, indecision  
- prophetic dreams replaced by nightmares that *feel* significant but are empty
