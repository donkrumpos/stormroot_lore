# Mythic Introduction
Sun is **truth without apology**.

Where Moon invites mystery and contemplation, Sun burns away ambiguity.  
A searing witness. A clarifying force. The pulse of daylight that reveals what shadows try to hold.

Sun is not “good” —  
its brilliance is as capable of cruelty as mercy.  
What it unveils cannot be unseen, and what it judges cannot easily hide.

Mortals stand straighter in Sun’s light,  
yet also feel the weight of their own imperfections.  
Clarity is a gift and a burden.

Sun teaches:
- honesty  
- discipline  
- righteous courage  
- the power of seeing things *exactly* as they are  

But too much light becomes blindness.  
Too much certainty becomes tyranny.

# Narrative Domain: Clarity
Sun governs:
- moments of revelation  
- moral tests  
- decisive actions  
- confrontations where nothing can be avoided  
- truths long buried but suddenly exposed  

Sun stories:
- demand choices  
- strip away illusion  
- turn subtext into text

Narrative traits:
- moral weight  
- direct consequences  
- decisive pacing  
- little ambiguity  

Sun does not offer nuance —  
it offers **reckoning**.

# Town Alignment: Sunspire (Virtue: Courage)
Sunspire is carved into a jagged ridge that catches dawnfire before any other settlement.  
Its towers shine with mirrored brass plates that redirect sunlight into its plazas.

Its people:
- wake before dawn for communal rites of greeting the light  
- prize honesty and honor  
- believe lies stain the spirit  
- forge sunmetal tools and weapons  
- train in disciplines that strengthen body, mind, and will  

When Sun dominates Sunspire:
- shadows shrink unnaturally  
- reflections appear sharper and more vibrant  
- tempers rise faster  
- truth-telling festivals begin spontaneously  
- children suddenly confess secrets to their parents  

Sunspire is a city that tries to live as if always being watched —  
not fearfully, but proudly.

# Dungeon Alignment: Blazebound (Clarity Manifest)
Blazebound is a crucible-dungeon forged in the First Age,  
where the primal dawn struck the molten heart of the world.

It manifests:
- corridors of heat-distorted air  
- arenas of molten stone  
- puzzles requiring precise timing and unwavering resolve  
- enemies that test courage directly — no deception, only challenge  

Mutations when Sun influence rises:
- rooms become brighter, hotter  
- fire constructs gain piercing “truthflame” attacks  
- illusions in other dungeons break temporarily  
- boss phases become more aggressive but more telegraphed  
- secrets within Blazebound reveal themselves visibly (even if dangerous to reach)  

Blazebound is the dungeon that tells players:  
“**Choose. Now.**”

# Deity Alignment: Solkara, the Spear of Day
**Titles:**  
- The Dawnblade  
- Keeper of the First Fire  
- She Who Sees All Paths  
- The Golden Witness  

Solkara is depicted as a tall, armor-clad figure  
whose face shines too brightly to behold directly.

She embodies:
- righteous resolve  
- burning purpose  
- the cost of doing what is right even when painful  

She grants:
- visions of truth  
- clarity in moments of fear  
- courage when one’s heart wavers  

But she demands:
- honesty  
- discipline  
- action when action is required  

Signs of her attention:
- a sudden beam of light illuminating only the player  
- heat without source  
- truth burning on the tongue, impossible to swallow  
- visions of what must be done (but never how)  

Solkara does not soothe.  
She strengthens.

# Quest Seeds (Procedural-Ready)
1. **The Trial of the False Dawn**  
   A ritual sunbeam chooses a champion — but chooses the wrong person.  
   Why?

2. **The Lie That Burned**  
   A child speaks a lie during a festival, and a shrine bursts into flame.

3. **The Sword That Sees**
