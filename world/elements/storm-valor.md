# Mythic Introduction
Storm is the **courage of the world made audible**.

Where Fire burns and Water recalls, Storm *insists* —  
it thunders awake whatever has grown complacent  
and demands movement where stillness has taken root.

Storm is the moment before a leap,  
the wild heartbeat,  
the lungful of air before shouting a truth that will change everything.

It is not fury; it is **clarity through upheaval**,  
a force that breaks stagnation the way lightning splits a stubborn oak  
so that something new may finally grow.

Storm does not punish.  
Storm **summons** — to rise, to choose, to act boldly.

# Narrative Domain: Valor
Storm governs:
- moments of decision  
- heroic acts (successful or tragic)  
- courage taken too far  
- sudden reversals  
- storms that arrive *inside* characters before they appear in the sky  

It is the domain of:
- ruptures  
- confrontations  
- oaths shouted over wind  
- last stands  

Storm stories often begin with silence  
and end with clarity — even if the cost was high.

Characters aligned with Storm:
- act before doubting  
- speak with dangerous honesty  
- refuse inertia  
- break patterns that needed breaking

# Town Alignment: Stormrest (Virtue: Valor)
Stormrest is a cliffside settlement overlooking the Thunderreach Sea,  
its houses anchored against constant crosswinds,  
its streets carved into switchbacks like lightning frozen in stone.

People of Stormrest:
- believe choices define a person more than birth  
- settle disputes with ritualized duels of words or blades  
- treat fear as a compass, not an obstacle  

When Storm dominates Stormrest:
- metal wind-chimes hum with unnatural resonance  
- the sky flickers with thin horizontal lightning  
- tempers flare but resolve quickly into camaraderie  
- old grudges boil to the surface for settling  

Stormrest festivals are loud, earnest, and brief —  
a celebration of making *any* decision rather than none.

# Dungeon Alignment: Skybreaker Maw (Valor Manifest)
Skybreaker Maw is a massive vertical wound in the world,  
formed where an ancient valor-titan struck the land with a weapon of pure will.

The dungeon is storm-as-architecture:
- suspended walkways swaying in relentless winds  
- lightning-forged creatures pacing the cliffs  
- puzzles based on timing, rhythm, and bravery  
- updrafts that allow leaps impossible anywhere else  

Dungeon behaviors under Storm influence:
- lightning arcs to bold players, sparing the timid  
- thunderclaps reset room states  
- platforms appear only when the player commits to a jump  
- certain doors open only after shouting a vow into the wind  

Skybreaker is not hostile —  
it is **challenging**,  
a teacher that speaks in gale-force lessons.

# Deity Alignment: Stormeid, the Oath-Breaker and Oath-Forged
**Titles:**  
- The Thunder That Remembers  
- He Who Tests the Spine  
- Lord of Upright Standing  
- The Storm That Bows to No One  

Stormeid is depicted as a tall figure wrapped in torn banners and crackling air,  
his eyes white as lightning,  
his voice the deep rolling thunder of an approaching front.

He teaches:
- courage over convenience  
- action over hesitation  
- truth over comfort  

He despises:
- cowardly silence  
- delayed justice  
- bravery used as spectacle rather than service  

Signs of his attention:
- sudden gusts indoors  
- hair rising on end  
- steel vibrating faintly  
- the taste of iron on the tongue before a moment of decision  

Stormeid’s blessings often come disguised as crises.

# Environmental Effects (Procedural Hooks)
When Storm dominates a region:
- winds shift to match narrative tension  
- lightning forks toward story-critical locations  
- cliff paths appear or erode  
- NPCs feel compelled to settle old disagreements  
- animals exhibit fearless behavior  
- horses spook at *truth*, not noise  

Storm “weather” amplifies:
- bravery  
- impulsiveness  
- confessions  
- duels  
- decisive acts the world had been waiting for

# Quest Seeds (Procedural-Ready)
1. **The Cliff That Waits for a Decision**  
   A cliffside walkway refuses to solidify until someone speaks the truth they’ve avoided.

2. **Lightning in the Bones**  
   A warrior’s skeleton begins to emit faint lightning, revealing a vow they broke long ago.

3. **The Duel That Never Ended**  
   Two spirits have been arguing mid-air for centuries; a mortal arbitrator is required to end the storm.

4. **Stormrest’s Falling Banners**  
   When Stormrest’s banners tear loose, they fly toward the person the town secretly believes their next leader should be.
