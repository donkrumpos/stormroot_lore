# Mythic Introduction
I have always felt that Water is the soft historian of Deluvia — a patient keeper of moments, not through ink or stone, but through *feeling*.  
A tide remembers by returning. A droplet remembers by clinging. A river remembers by refusing to take the same shape twice.

Memory in Deluvia isn’t kept in books.  
It’s kept in **currents**.

Where water moves, stories surface.  
Where it pools, secrets deepen.  
Where it freezes, truths are held in suspension, waiting for thaw.

Water is not sentimental.  
It remembers because the world must.

# Elemental Attributes
**Core Nature:** Reflective, receptive, cyclical

**Vice:** Deception (when memory becomes selective)

**Color:** Deep azure

# Narrative Domain: Memory
Water governs:
- resurfacing past events  
- emotional echoes  
- NPC recollection  
- the illusion of déjà vu  
- time loops, but only the soft ones  
- secrets that insist on being found  

Memory under Water is not perfect recall — it is **return**.

---

# Town Alignment: Rothigport (Virtue: Humility)
Water aligns with Rothigport because:
- the people live by honest work at the tide’s mercy  
- humility is the act of remembering one’s place in the world  
- the harbor is a bowl of shared histories

When Water dominates Rothigport:
- NPCs become more reflective  
- old grievances resurface  
- fishermen speak of “echo tides”  
- the town holds spontaneous remembrance rituals  
- lost objects wash ashore with improbable timing

---

# Dungeon Alignment: Niv-Rath Hollow (Vice: Vanity)
The Water-side dungeon manifests the *danger of remembering too much*.

**Vice Expression:**  
- illusions of past choices  
- reflections that lie  
- watery avatars mimicking companions  
- “truths” distorted into vanity

Dungeon mutations under Water:
- mirrored corridors  
- flooding events that replay memories  
- jars of preserved whispers  
- waterlogged spirits drawn to unfinished stories

---

# Deity Alignment: Myrathe, the Tide-Scribe
**Titles:**  
- She Who Hears the Undertide  
- The Remembering Foam  
- Archivist of Droplets

Myrathe embodies Water’s impartial memory:
- calm, observant, rarely intervening  
- keeps record through tide patterns  
- speaks in dreams that feel like nostalgia

When a region draws Myrathe’s attention:
- waters become unusually reflective  
- children dream of places they’ve never seen  
- forgotten things call to the living

---

# Environmental Effects (Procedural Hooks)
When Water dominates a region:
- increased rainfall or fog  
- wellsprings produce shimmering brineglass  
- underground aquifers begin echoing voices  
- lost items drift toward players  
- NPCs recall past interactions more vividly

---

# NPC Archetypes (System-Usable)
Water-aligned NPCs:
- archivists  
- tidewalkers  
- dream cartographers  
- soft-spoken liars  
- elderly mentors with perfect narrative timing  

Water NPC traits:
- speaks in comparisons (“This feels like…”)
- pauses often, as if checking inward tides
- never forgets promises

---

# Quest Seeds (Procedural-Ready)
1. **The Echo Jar**  
   A jar of seawater records the last argument someone had before dying. Someone wants it opened.

2. **Tide That Returned the Wrong Thing**  
   The sea brought back a boat that left with four people… but five shadows move inside it.

3. **The Forgotten Festival**  
   Townsfolk swear they held a festival every year — yet no one remembers what it celebrated.

4. **A Memory That Wants a Body**  
   A fragment of someone’s past tries to incarnate as a waterlogged spirit.

---

# Shrine Behavior
Shrines to Water:
- glow softly when truth is spoken nearby  
- reject offerings given insincerely  
- amplify memories during rituals  
- allow players glimpses of unseen past events

Shrine corruption symptoms:
- illusions of “better times”  
- clinging mist that confuses direction  
- whispers that say what the listener *wants* to hear

---

# Canonical Truths
- Water remembers everything, but reveals selectively.  
- Memory is not past — it is **return**.  
- Myrathe never lies, but her truths may arrive distorted by the tides.  
- Rothigport’s humility is strengthened through remembrance.  
- Niv-Rath Hollow reveals the danger of memory unmoored from truth.
