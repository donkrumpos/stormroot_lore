# Mythic Introduction
Wind is **the first choice the world ever made**.

Before Fire burned, before Water remembered, before Soil settled itself into shape —  
Wind stirred.  
A soft, curious movement, the earliest gesture of **intention**.

Wind is not forceful like Storm, nor patient like Soil.  
It is **direction without demand**,  
the subtle guidance a bird feels when it takes flight,  
the gentle nudge that turns a wanderer down a new path  
without ever revealing *why*.

Wind is the breath between thoughts —  
the whisper that suggests a possibility.

It is the quiet tutor that asks:  
**“Where do you truly wish to go?”**

# Narrative Domain: Intention
Wind governs:
- beginnings  
- subtle choices  
- instinctive decisions  
- the invisible line between desire and action  
- journeys both physical and emotional  

Wind stories:
- start with a calling  
- unfold through wandering or discovery  
- emphasize introspection and soft guidance  
- give players “nudges” rather than demands  

Narrative traits:
- branching possibilities  
- exploration  
- personal clarity revealed through movement  
- reliance on intuition  

Wind is the story that starts with a breeze through an open window.

# Town Alignment: Aerlum Ridge (Virtue: Wisdom)
Aerlum Ridge sits upon sheer cliffs where air currents weave like living silk.  
Homes are built vertically, linked by hanging bridges and glider ramps.  
Wind chimes of bone, quartz, and silver create an ever-present music.

Its people:
- believe choices should be made slowly and with clarity  
- consult “wind oracles,” readers of banners and drifting petals  
- study philosophy as attentively as archery  
- use gliders to travel between terraces  

When Wind dominates Aerlum Ridge:
- sound carries unnaturally far  
- whispers become easy to overhear  
- lost items blow into the hands of those who need them  
- flocks of sky-creatures migrate oddly  
- intuition strengthens  

Corruption (Aimlessness) causes:
- wandering sickness (people walk without knowing where or why)  
- confusion storms  
- indecision among leaders  
- banners twisting themselves into knots  

A common Aerlum proverb:  
**“A single breath can change a journey.”**

# Dungeon Alignment: Galehollow (Intention Distorted)
Galehollow is a vast cavern-labyrinth carved by ancient winds that once tunneled through the living mantle of Deluvia.

It manifests:
- spiraling chambers of constant wind  
- floating platforms  
- passages that open only when players move with the correct intention  
- puzzles requiring coordinated movement or emotional alignment  

Dungeon personality:
- playful but testing  
- revealing through subtle cues  
- always shifting, but never malicious  

Mutations when Wind influence rises:
- gust-bridges appear between cliffs  
- enemies gain gliding or soaring abilities  
- whispered hints emanate from cracks  
- rooms rotate gently like weather vanes  
- environmental hazards require directional timing  

Under corruption (Aimlessness):
- wind becomes chaotic, directionless  
- paths lead in circles  
- illusions of choice appear (false branching)  
- enemies drift endlessly, attacking out of confusion rather than aggression  

Galehollow asks the question:  
**“Do you know where your heart is pointing?”**

# Deity Alignment: Aeralune, the Veiled Guide
**Titles:**  
- The Quiet Arrow  
- Mother of Winds  
- Keeper of the Invisible Paths  
- She Who Listens Before She Speaks  

Aeralune is depicted as a tall, willowy figure  
whose cloak dissolves into wind at its hem,  
and whose eyes are calm yet searching.

She teaches:
- patience  
- listening  
- honest intention  
- the wisdom to choose well  

She discourages:
- rash action  
- wandering without purpose  
- ignoring inner guidance  
- forcing the world to conform to one’s will  

Signs of her attention:
- a sudden directional breeze indoors  
- feathers falling where no birds fly  
- dust patterns forming arrows or spirals  
- the sensation of being gently turned  

Aeralune’s blessings:
- clarity  
- improved intuition  
- safer travel  
- reduced fear when exploring  

She is the whisper before revelation.

- multiple solutions appear subtly  
- riddles rely on player intuition  
- wisdom-based outcomes become available  

Wind rewards:
- listening  
- thoughtful action  
- intentional choices  

It punishes:
- stubbornness  
- ignoring environmental cues  
- rushing

# Shrine Behavior
Shrines to Wind:
- emit gentle breezes  
- spin objects slowly in circles  
- whisper faint guidance  
- accept offerings placed on featherstone plates (wind must move them to be accepted)  

Corruption symptoms (Aimlessness):
- shrines cause dizziness  
- offerings scatter into the wild  
- pilgrims lose their sense of direction  
- wind “howls” with indecision
