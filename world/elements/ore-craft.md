# Mythic Introduction
Ore is the **heartbeat beneath the mountain**,  
the slow, patient rhythm that formed the bones of Deluvia long before water carved its first river.

It is **endurance**, **foundation**, **structure**, and above all, **craft** —  
the sacred art of turning raw potential into purpose.

Where Fire transforms through destruction, Ore transforms through shaping.  
Where Wind directs intention, Ore gives intention *weight*.  
Where Storm tests courage in the moment, Ore teaches the courage to finish what one begins.

Ore is the quiet truth:
**“Nothing great is made quickly.”**

Its spirit is found in anvils, in buried veins of bright metal,  
in the sound of hammer meeting glowing ore,  
in the steady work of hands that refuse to give up.

Ore is patience with momentum.

# Narrative Domain: Craft
Ore governs:
- creation  
- invention  
- engineering  
- reforging broken things  
- hard-won lessons and earned skill  
- the relationships between maker, tool, and material  

Its domain emphasizes:
- perseverance over brilliance  
- improvement over inspiration  
- identity shaped through labor  

Narrative traits:
- a long arc of building toward something meaningful  
- problems solved through patience rather than flare  
- characters who redefine themselves through work  

Ore stories honor the truth that **making something changes the maker**.

# Town Alignment: Ironwell (Virtue: Diligence)
Ironwell is a cavern-city illuminated by rivers of molten glass and glowing steel channels.  
Great forge chimneys rise like stone guardians, belching white smoke that blankets the morning ridge.

Its people:
- work with ritualistic discipline  
- believe the worth of a thing lies in how well it is made  
- hold apprenticeships as sacred contracts  
- value tools not for beauty but for lineage and reliability  

When Ore dominates Ironwell:
- forges burn hotter, longer  
- craftsmen work through the night without exhaustion  
- new alloys spontaneously emerge in the smelt pools  
- abandoned tools ring softly when someone walks by  

But when Ore is corrupted (Stagnation):
- innovation dies  
- craftsmen refuse any new methods  
- the clang of hammers becomes discordant  
- unfinished projects pile into labyrinthine hoards  

Ironwell’s saying:  
**“A good life is forged, not found.”**

# Dungeon Alignment: Rustcrown (Craft Distorted)
Rustcrown is the domain where craft curdles into obsession.  
Built inside an ancient foundry-city swallowed by collapse,  
its halls are forests of twisted metal, abandoned scaffolds, and half-finished constructs.

Rustcrown manifests:
- golems that endlessly “repair” things that should remain broken  
- corridors that rearrange like clockwork machinery  
- rust storms that eat armor and tools  
- puzzles requiring symmetrical construction or timed assembly  

Mutations when Ore influence rises:
- constructs gain new limbs or tools  
- metal fauna appear (iron serpents, steel-backed beetles)  
- discarded relics animate  
- forge-fires ignite and spread uncontrollably  
- rooms require crafting solutions (repairing bridges, rebuilding mechanisms)  

Rustcrown teaches the shadow of diligence:  
**“If I do not stop, everything will be perfect.”**

# Deity Alignment: Khel-Druun, Father of the First Forge
**Titles:**  
- The World-Smith  
- Maker of Masks  
- Lord of Iron Quietude  
- He Who Brought Shape to the Shapeless  

Khel-Druun appears as a massive, bare-chested figure  
with a forge for a heart and hands scarred by ancient creation.

He teaches:
- discipline  
- work without complaint  
- mastery through repetition  
- devotion to craft as spiritual practice  

He discourages:
- shortcuts  
- waste  
- unfinished work  
- pride not rooted in skill  

Signs of his attention:
- tools vibrating faintly  
- metal becoming warm in one’s grip  
- sparks that fall in deliberate patterns  
- sudden insight into how a thing should be made  

Khel-Druun’s blessings often appear as:
- improvement of skill  
- steady hands  
- the ability to repair what others consider ruined  

He is strict, but fair.

# Environmental Effects (Procedural Hooks)
Ore influence causes:
- more structures to appear in wilderness (ruined foundries, old scaffolds)  
- increased crafting recipe discoveries  
- higher durability of crafted items  
- mining yields rare ores  
- lower spawn rates of “chaos-born” monsters  
- increased incidence of mechanical hazards  

Narrative shifts:
- characters pursue self-improvement  
- quests focus on building, repairing, or restoring  
- factions become protective of their tools and craft  
- problems require persistence rather than clever tricks

# NPC Archetypes (System-Usable)
Ore-aligned NPCs:
- smiths  
- engineers  
- stonewrights  
- relic forgers  
- golem artificers  
- underforge monks  

Traits:
- reserved  
- methodical  
- slow to trust but loyal  
- constructive in both speech and action  
- fond of metaphors involving tools or metal  

Common Ironwell saying:  
**“Only the mountain has patience enough to judge work.”**

---

# Quest Seeds (Procedural-Ready)
1. **The Broken Anvil**  
   An anvil in Ironwell begins humming — a sign something wants to be forged.

2. **The Golem That Forgot Its Purpose**  
   A gentle golem wanders Sunspire, asking for help remembering what it was built to do.

3. **The Nail That Wouldn’t Bend**  
   A single nail forged in Ironwell becomes unbreakable and begins altering nearby metal.

4. **The Smith Who Dreams of Fire**  
   A master smith refuses to sleep as visions of impossible tools flood their mind.

# Shrine Behavior
Shrines to Ore:
- resonate with a low metallic hum  
- cause nearby metal to align neatly  
- offer blessings that strengthen craftsmanship and durability  
- accept offerings of tools, ore, or completed works  

Corruption symptoms (Stagnation):
- tools become heavy and unwieldy  
- shrines demand perfection, rejecting anything flawed  
- craftsmen rework completed items endlessly  
- minor constructs form spontaneously from scrap  
- forge fires refuse to extinguish
