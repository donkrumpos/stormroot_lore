# Mythic Introduction
Poison is not merely a toxin in Deluvia — it is **what happens when truth ferments too long**.

Every secret sweats a little venom.  
Every broken oath leaks a slow, invisible rot.  
Corruption isn’t sudden; it is *polite* at first, settling softly like mold on a forgotten loaf.

Poison teaches, in its cruel way, that corruption is rarely imposed —  
it is invited, welcomed in tiny increments,  
**a drip of surrender at a time**.

Yet Poison is not purely evil.  
It reveals what was hidden, strips illusions, and forces transformation through discomfort.  
In a hakoniwa world so whimsical and soft-edged, Poison is the sharp reminder that shadows bloom beneath even the friendliest mushrooms.

# Narrative Domain: Corruption
Poison governs:
- the slow erosion of trust  
- hidden agendas  
- sickening truths forced into the open  
- temptation, whispers, forbidden knowledge  
- stories about compromise, downfall, and grim honesty  

It is not chaos — it is **the rot that grows in orderly silence**.

Characters shaped by Poison often:
- know things they wish they didn’t  
- smile with a question behind their teeth  
- carry guilt like perfume

# Town Alignment: Fenwick Hollow (Vice: Corruption)
Fenwick Hollow is a quiet settlement built among blackleaf trees whose branches drip with perpetual dew — each bead slightly too bitter to taste.

Locals are:
- polite to a fault  
- evasive in the charming way  
- excellent at smiling while hiding grief  

When Poison dominates Fenwick:
- rumors move faster than truth  
- trade agreements involve strange caveats  
- fungal lanterns emit faint violet halos  
- “gifts” circulate, each with an unspoken expectation  
- wells turn metallic-tasting but remain technically safe  

Yet Fenwick’s corruption is rarely malicious —  
it is **the corruption of accumulated unspoken feelings**,  
of grief stuffed into cupboards,  
of kindness offered with a hidden hook.

# Dungeon Alignment: Noxspire (Corruption Manifest)
Noxspire is a vertical labyrinth, a tower grown from dead vines and calcified spores.  
Its architecture resembles a plant that *learned envy*.

Vice Expression:
- claustrophobic branching paths  
- poison vents triggered by emotional dishonesty  
- creatures twisted by half-completed metamorphosis  
- memories that replay with altered outcomes  

Dungeon mutations under Poison:
- fungal hearts pulse behind walls  
- serpent-spirits whisper options that feel too reasonable  
- the tower grows slightly whenever a player lies  
- poison pools copy the player’s reflection — but older and disappointed  

Despite its malice, Noxspire is *honest*:  
it never attacks without revealing some truth the victim had avoided.

# Deity Alignment: Serith Noxbloom, the Velvet Blight
**Titles:**  
- Mother of Soft Spoil  
- Keeper of Kindly Rot  
- The Violet Mask  
- She-Who-Whispers-Second-Thoughts  

Serith appears as a robed figure crowned in bioluminescent mushrooms,  
her smile compassionate, her presence unsettlingly gentle.

She teaches:
- that all things decay, and decay reveals what is real  
- that betrayal often begins as a kindness  
- that honesty is sharp, but corruption is soft  

Serith blesses:
- those who acknowledge their flaws openly  
- those who understand the cost of knowledge  
- those who do not pretend purity  

Her signs include:
- mushrooms blooming in perfect rings overnight  
- ink-black tears found on pillows  
- dreams of serpents coiled around glowing acorns

# Environmental Effects (Procedural Hooks)
When Poison dominates a region:
- small animals behave strangely: too confident or too still  
- mushrooms emit faint, misleading lights  
- traders offer irresistible deals with hidden consequences  
- wells, ponds, or barrels acquire dreamy reflections  
- abandoned items whisper faint emotional impressions  

NPC mood shifts toward:
- suspicion  
- temptation  
- mirth with an undertow of dread

- serpent-charmers  
- fungal seers  

Traits:
- sly warmth  
- elliptical phrasing

- apologies offered with rehearsed grace

# Quest Seeds (Procedural-Ready)
1. **The Gift That Waits to Be Returned**  
   A villager gives the player an Allzeer Acorn “for luck.”  
   It begins whispering fears that aren’t entirely wrong.

2. **Rot Beneath the Floorboards**  
   A house sinks slowly every night, as if embarrassed by its occupants’ secrets.

3. **The Snake That Learned to Speak**  
   A serpent offers to reveal a truth about the player —  
   but demands one lie in return.

4. **Thirteen Lanterns of Fenwick**  
   Lanterns around town start glowing violet.  
   One of them is telling the truth.  
   The others are telling what people *wish* was true.

# Shrine Behavior
Shrines to Poison react beautifully, unnervingly:
- offerings sprout tiny glowing mushrooms  
- whispered prayers echo back in altered wording  
- reflections in water bowls smile independently  
- incorrect confessions produce gentle, mocking laughter  
- honesty cleanses poison clouds instantly  

Corruption symptoms:
- shrines become overgrown with inkcap fungi  
- poison shadows pool like liquid tar  
- offerings decay instantly  
- spectral serpents coil around visitors’ ankles
