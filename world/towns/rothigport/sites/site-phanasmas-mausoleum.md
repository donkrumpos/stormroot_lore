## Overview

Phanasma’s Mausoleum rests on a small, fog-shrouded island just beyond the main harbor lights of Rothigport. Officially, it is a noble tomb. Unofficially, it is a wound that never closed.

I treat this site as a **Water–Moon–Death triad dungeon**, where memory, illusion, and unfinished endings fold in on themselves.

## Mythic Tone

- Water remembers what the family denies.
- Moon distorts truth into rumor and reflection.
- Death refuses closure.

## Narrative Function

This is not a simple crypt crawl.  
It is a place where **absence is louder than presence**, and where the town’s political rot leaks into the afterlife.

## Dungeon Seeds

- shifting corridors that rearrange after each tide
- spectral twins bound to unresolved oaths
- an undead architect trapped between design and decay
- relics that replay memories instead of granting power

## Canonical Truths

- Phanasma’s death was staged.
- The mausoleum does not fully belong to the dead.
- The site reacts to those who carry guilt, ambition, or grief.
