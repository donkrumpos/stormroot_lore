## Overview

Blackthorn Bridge spans the southern harbor, binding Rothigport’s eastern guild districts to the poorer western docks. It is a marvel of craft — and a lightning rod for resentment.

## Mythic Tone

- Water flows beneath, indifferent to class.
- Ore holds fast, enforcing division.

## Narrative Function

The bridge is both **connection and accusation**.  
It is where protests gather, toll disputes ignite, and rumors travel faster than goods.

## Story Hooks

- toll riots and sabotage
- secret compartments beneath planks
- hidden listening posts used by smugglers and spies

## Canonical Truths

- The bridge unified the town physically.
- It fractured the town politically.
- Whoever controls the bridge controls the narrative of fairness.
