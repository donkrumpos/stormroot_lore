# Rothigport  
### *Haven-of-the-Drifting-Tide* (ancient / poetic / bardic name)

# Mythic Preface

Before the guilds placed their ledgers on the docks…  
before the causeway tethered the floating shanties to the solid island…  
before the names *Rothigport* or *Song Tide* were ever spoken…

there was only **the Haven**.

A place the tides did not swallow.  
A place the storms forgot.  
A place where memory—like water—held its shape.

The old bards say:

> *“If you drift long enough, the Haven will find you.”*

The oldest maps call it **Haven-of-the-Drifting-Tide**.  
But the younger kingdoms, practical and paperwork-bound, renamed it **Rothigport**, and so it appears on trade routes, tariffs, and guild decrees.

Both truths coexist.  
One is the skeleton; the other is the soul.

# Founding & Purpose

Rothigport was not founded once — it **accreted**.

The first Tidedrifters lashed their boats together during a century of coastal warfare, creating a floating refuge:

- too unstable for siege engines  
- too slippery for raiders  
- too mobile to map with certainty  

What began as improvised survival became a way of life:

- docks moored to docks  
- homes built atop rafts and pilings  
- rope bridges spanning narrow canals  
- chimneys rising from platforms that never touch soil  

The sea was their wall.  
The mists were their shield.  
The Moon was their witness.

Over five centuries the shanty cluster expanded, stabilized, beautified, and eventually bureaucratized — giving rise to the official name **Rothigport**.

Yet even today, when storms roll in from the east and the harbor lamps flicker in the fog, the townsfolk murmur:

> *“The Haven wakes.”*

---

# Song Tide Context

Rothigport is the northern market heart of the Song Tide Archipelago — the crossroads where:

- fishermen sell the night’s catch  
- shipwrights trade timber for brass  
- bards test storm-calming or storm-breaking songs  
- refugees from the Central Kingdoms melt into drifting anonymity  

It is not the richest nor the safest town in Song Tide.

But it is the most *alive* — a town built on improvisation, risk, and shared survival.

# The Causeway & The Great Drift

The recent construction of **Modrik’s Causeway**, linking Rothigport to the island of Noctisbard, has fractured the town’s identity.

Half the populace calls it progress.  
The other half calls it an anchor driven through their mythic heart.

The old Tidedrifters mutter:

> *“A Haven should drift.  
A port should root.  
We are becoming both… and neither.”*

This tension now shapes Rothigport’s politics, festivals, and fears.

# Magic & The Quiet Veil

Magic permeates Song Tide — but never loudly in Rothigport.

Because emissaries from the Central Kingdoms occasionally check for arcane “infractions,” the Arcanists Guild maintains a network of:

- backroom apprenticeships  
- moonlit lessons on drifting barges  
- wards disguised as lantern posts  
- sigils carved discreetly into pilings  

Moon-influence is palpable here:

- fog that moves *against* the wind  
- dreams that shift with the tides  
- waterfolk emerging from the depths with prophecy in their eyes  

Rothigport’s magic is subtle, tidal, half-buried under barnacles and quiet oaths.

# Guilds & Power Structure

Despite its mysticism, Rothigport’s daily life runs on guild logic and political maneuvering.

## The Five Great Guilds

### 1. Lumberjacks Guild (Oldest, Revered)
Tradition-keepers who insist the town remain built of wood.  
They forbid stone construction — a taboo still broadly respected.

### 2. Shipbuilders Guild
Home to rival companies Heneesri and Lordiyan.  
Innovation, infrastructure, and maritime engineering meet here.

### 3. Fishermen’s Guild (Historically Prestigious)
Controls tariffs, exports, and seasonal rituals tied to tide cycles.

### 4. Bards Guild
Stormcallers, tide-singers, and moon-chanters.  
Their music shapes the weather more often than rumors admit.

### 5. Arcanists Guild
A discreet academic network.  
Protects young mages, hides their work, shepherds them through danger.

## Other Lodges & Circles

- **Greenmen’s Lodge** — ritual naturalists  
- **Dockstayer’s Lodge** — harbor maintenance and lantern rites  
- **Song Swellers Lodge** — Orinsol ale mystics, chaotic visionaries  
- **Morgramel Circle** — superstitious moon-mages in hiding

# Factions & Fragile Balance

The Haven floats not just through engineering…  
but through uneasy relationships.

### Major Factions

- **House Blackthorn** — shipping magnates, working-class heroes, covert spies  
- **House Prigtoon (Ketapesh)** — richest merchants, politically ambitious, internally rotting  
- **Pirate Lodges** (Parmite, Nortide, Scarburry) — equal parts threat and asset  
- **Bardic Clans** — tide-wailers and stormcallers  
- **Magic Exiles** — Nemedi, Formori, Prismarese, and others who hide in the fog  

Atmospheric Truth:  
You never know who you’re speaking to under a dockside lantern — a refugee, a smuggler, a bard, or a mage pretending not to be one.

# Spirit of the Haven (Culture)

The sea is not scenery.  
It is the fourth wall of the town.

Tidedrifters believe:

- a person without a rope in hand is a person adrift  
- every tide remembers something  
- the Moon judges lies better than any court  
- a floating town mirrors the souls of its people  
- storms are teachers, not punishments  

### Common Rites

- **Lantern-Sending** — releasing drift-lanterns for mourning or celebration  
- **Rope-Swearing** — vows tied with salt-soaked cord  
- **Mist-Walks** — seeking visions in heavy fog  
- **Tidebones** — divination with fishbones and pebbles  

---

# Threats on the Horizon

### Druvvenrog’s Gaze
Eastern industrial powers whisper about expanding westward.  
Tidedrifters check their harpoons more often.

### Kraken Regnareeg
A mythic sentinel — beast, god, or memory the sea refuses to unmake.

### The Rot
A Death-plague drifting north from Wraithwood.  
Floating architecture once saved the Haven, but plagues respect no tide.

### The Keepers of the Book of Bones
A cult beneath the cemetery island, drawn to Death-element resonance.

# Phanasma’s Tale (Dungeon Seed)

Phanasma Prigtoon, beloved of Rothigport’s secret mages, vanished before her staged “death.”

Her mausoleum is a **Water–Moon–Death triad dungeon**:

- shifting lunar passages  
- memory echoes in brackish pools  
- spectral twins guarding threshold-rooms  
- the architect Sedladus, trapped between life and closure  

This is more than a crypt.  
It is a mythic hinge in the story ecology of the Haven.
