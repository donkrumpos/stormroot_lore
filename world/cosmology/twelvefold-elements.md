# The Twelvefold Elements of Deluvia

## Mythic Introduction
Long before shrines and stories, before beetlefolk carved their tunnels or moonlight learned to dream, Deluvia stirred in her sleep. Her first exhalation fractured into **twelve tones**—twelve moods of the dreaming land.

These were not elements in the alchemical sense, nor the tidy categories of scholars.  
They were *instincts*, *yearnings*, *emotional weather patterns* within the great hakoniwa-mind of the world.

The Twelvefold are Deluvia’s oldest truths.  
Every town, dungeon, deity, omen, and story-thread grows from them.

They are not fact—they are **feeling made law**.

# The Twelvefold

Each element carries:
- a **Virtue** (when the land is in balance)  
- a **Vice** (when the land is wounded or distorted)  
- a **Narrative Domain** (how stories emerge through that tone)  
- a **Mythic Role** in creation  
- and a **Gameplay Role** in Stormroot's physics, magic, and ecology.

# Elemental Interplay (The Mythic Physics)

The Twelvefold are not isolated—they influence one another:

- **Water softens Fire** (memory cools zeal)  
- **Fire reshapes Ore** (molten change)  
- **Ore divides Wind** (form constrains intention)  
- **Wind feeds Life** (carrying seeds)  
- **Life resists Poison** (renewal fights rot)  
- **Poison devours Soil** (decay eating bedrock)  
- **Soil quenches Storm** (earth swallows thunder)  
- **Storm fractures Moonlight** (uneasy dreams)  
- **Moon reveals Sun's blind spots**  
- **Sun purifies Water**  
- **Chaos disrupts all order**  
- **Death balances Life**  

These rules guide:
- dungeon mutations  
- shrine behavior  
- NPC mood drift  
- pantheon attention  
- quest generators  
- dungeon generation  
- narrative ecology  
- and mythic emergence

# The Twelvefold as the Foundation of Stormroot

Every system uses this canon:

## Narrative Engine
Each Story Signal is encoded with its corresponding element.

## Dungeon Mutation
Dungeons mutate according to their elemental imbalance.

## Town Virtue/Vice States
Each town embodies the *virtue* of its element.  
Its paired dungeon expresses the *vice*.

## Pantheon Attention
Each deity is an elemental persona.  
Disturbances attract their notice.

## Procedural Generators
Quests, NPCs, shrines, rituals, lore fragments —  
all draw from the Twelvefold’s tones.

## Magic System
Spell schools map directly onto elemental Truths.

This file is the **bedrock**.

Everything else is a branch.

# Canonical Closing

I root the Twelvefold into the Weave of Deluvia.  
Let every shrine, every dungeon, every whispered NPC rumor bend toward these twelve moods.

May the world dream truly.
