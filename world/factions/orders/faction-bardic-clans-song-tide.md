## Overview

The Bardic Clans do not merely sing — they negotiate with weather.

## Narrative Function

I use them to:
- regulate storms
- preserve oral history
- compete with centralized bardic orders

## Canonical Truths

- Songs can calm or summon tides.
- The Moon judges false notes.
- Not all bards belong to a hall.
