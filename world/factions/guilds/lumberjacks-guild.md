# Lumberjacks Guild of Rothigport

The oldest and most respected guild in town, guardians of Rothigport’s wooden heritage. Their traditions keep stone architecture at bay, ensuring the Haven remains buoyant, flexible, and alive. Even as lumber demand declines, their cultural power endures; what they say feels like law.
