# The Twelve Elements of Deluvia

## Mythic Introduction

Deluvia is stitched together from twelve great currents.  
They are not just “damage types” or “schools of magic.”  
They are **ways the world thinks and feels**.

Every storm, every shrine, every god, every beetlefolk burrow and forgotten ruin  
leans toward some combination of these twelve.

I call them **the Twelve Elements**, and they sit on a wheel —  
not as enemies, but as tensions, harmonies, and crossing lines.

This document is my single source of truth for what each element really means.

# Design Intent

I use the Twelve Elements to:

- anchor the **Mythic Vector System**  
- color the **Narrative Engine** and story ecology  
- define **magic schools**, **dungeon alignments**, and **ritual types**  
- tie virtue/vice to deeper metaphysics instead of shallow morality  
- keep mechanics, lore, and aesthetics speaking a shared language  

If something exists in Deluvia, it expresses itself somewhere on this wheel.

# The Twelvefold Wheel (Overview)

Here are the twelve elements and their core phrases:

- **Water** — memory, emotion, tides of feeling  
- **Fire** — transformation, hunger, volatile change  
- **Soil** — humility, burden, patience, grounded truth  
- **Poison** — corruption, temptation, beautiful rot  
- **Storm** — upheaval, courage, violent revelation  
- **Moon** — illusion, secrets, dream-thresholds  
- **Sun** — clarity, revelation, harsh or gentle truth  
- **Ore** — craft, forging, will impressed into matter  
- **Chaos** — chance, anomaly, broken pattern  
- **Wind** — intention, direction, choice, freedom  
- **Life** — growth, fertility, healing, entanglement  
- **Death** — closure, endings, silence, inevitable limits  

Each element has:

- a **narrative role**
- **visual and atmospheric cues**
- **virtue/vice affinities**
- a **magical expression**
- a **shadow side**

I treat these as stable over time.

Water drowns.  
Obsession, grief loops, and identities sunken under old tides.

# Fire — Transformation & Hunger

---

# Death — Closure & Silence

Death doesn’t equal evil.  
It is the quiet gatekeeper of limits: stories must end, bodies must rest, cycles must complete.

# Elemental Interactions (High-Level)

I treat the wheel as a **field of tensions**, not strict oppositions, but there are strong polarities:

- **Water ↔ Fire**: memory vs. change, grief vs. eruption  
- **Soil ↔ Wind**: rooted vs. wandering  
- **Poison ↔ Life**: rot vs. growth (but often intertwined)  
- **Sun ↔ Moon**: clarity vs. ambiguity  
- **Ore ↔ Chaos**: structure vs. anomaly  
- **Storm ↔ Death**: upheaval vs. closure  

These tensions feed:

- dungeon design  
- virtue/vice interpretations  
- NPC mythic signatures  
- regional vector drift  

---

# Usage Across Systems

I rely on these definitions when I:

- build **Mythic Vectors** for regions, towns, dungeons, NPCs  
- design **magic schools** and spell lists  
- decide how a **dungeon mutates** under certain pressures  
- connect **virtue/vice** to something deeper than mere morality  
- guide **procedural storytelling** tone and imagery  

This file is the canonical “what the elements really mean” reference.

# Canonical Truths

- Deluvia’s metaphysics are built on a Twelvefold Elemental Wheel.  
- Each element has narrative, mechanical, and symbolic weight.  
- No element is purely good or evil; each has virtue and shadow.  
- All other systems (vectors, virtues, magic, dungeons, NPCs) reference this file as their elemental ground.  
- If I ever change an element’s meaning, I must revise this document first and propagate from here.
